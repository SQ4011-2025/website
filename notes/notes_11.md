## Recap

* Over these past ten weeks, you have been drinking from the proverbial firehose.
* During this course, you learned to program in many different languages; indeed, our great hope is that you *learned how to program* in them all, regardless of the language.
* Consider back to the beginning of the course when you worked on Mario: You have come so far and have gained so many skills.
* You should measure your success as the delta between your skill at the start of the course and your skill now, at the end of the course.
* Further, we hope that you *learned how to solve problems* above all else, how to take input, process it through an algorithm, and produce some output. To that point, we played a game where we drew a picture using verbal instructions.
* Notice how some verbal instructions were *higher level* and others were *lower level*, like the different programming languages utilized in this course.
* Notice how some instructions were more specific than others. Remember times when you had to refine your code to do exactly as you wanted.
* Also, notice how some instructions were abstracted away, like *draw arms*. This is similar to how we abstracted away code into functions.
* Looking at all the weeks of the course, you gathered tools and built skills. Above all, though, you learned how to teach yourself.
* Your final project is your opportunity to build a project, using these skills, that is of your specification and design. We hope you will join us for our [Hackathon](https://sq4007-2025.github.io/website/module-extras.html), an epic late-nighter wherein we work together on our final projects.

## Looking Ahead

* As you journey from the work of this course to the world outside CS50, you may want to take a number of steps to prepare and adventure out.
* Journeying on, [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and learn about VS Code.
* To be able to execute commands on the terminal, much like you did in The Sandbox, install command-line tools on your [Mac](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or [PC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).
* Learn more about [Git](https://youtu.be/MJUJ4wbFm_A).
* Host a website using [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) and/or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
* If applicable, host a web app using [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/), or [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/edu/students).
* Ask questions in relevant online communities.
* Ask questions using AI-based tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).
* Join one of our many [communities](https://cs50.harvard.edu/communities).
