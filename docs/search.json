    "section": "Object-Oriented Programming",
    "text": "Object-Oriented Programming\n\nThere are different paradigms of programming. As you learn other languages, you will start recognizing patterns like these.\nUp until this point, you have worked procedurally step-by-step.\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) is a compelling solution to programming-related problems.\nTo begin, type code student.py in the terminal window and code as follows:\nname = input(\"Name: \")\nhouse = input(\"House: \")\nprint(f\"{name} from {house}\")\nNotice that this program follows a procedural, step-by-step paradigm: Much like you have seen in prior parts of this course.\nDrawing on our work from previous weeks, we can create functions to abstract away parts of this program.\ndef main():\n    name = get_name()\n    house = get_house()\n    print(f\"{name} from {house}\")\n\n\ndef get_name():\n    return input(\"Name: \")\n\n\ndef get_house():\n    return input(\"House: \")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how get_name and get_house abstract away some of the needs of our main function. Further, notice how the final lines of the code above tell the interpreter to run the main function.\nWe can further simplify our program by storing the student as a tuple. A tuple is a sequence of values. Unlike a list, a tuple can’t be modified. In spirit, we are returning two values.\ndef main():\n    name, house = get_student()\n    print(f\"{name} from {house}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return name, house\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how get_student returns name, house.\nPacking that tuple, such that we are able to return both items to a variable called student, we can modify our code as follows.\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(f\"{student[0]} from {student[1]}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return (name, house)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice that (name, house) explicitly tells anyone reading our code that we are returning two values within one. Further, notice how we can index into tuples using student[0] or student[1].\ntuples are immutable, meaning we cannot change those values. Immutability is a way by which we can program defensively.\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    if student[0] == \"Padma\":\n        student[1] = \"Ravenclaw\"\n    print(f\"{student[0]} from {student[1]}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return name, house\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice that this code produces an error. Since tuples are immutable, we’re not able to reassign the value of student[1].\nIf we wanted to provide our fellow programmers flexibility, we could utilize a list as follows.\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    if student[0] == \"Padma\":\n        student[1] = \"Ravenclaw\"\n    print(f\"{student[0]} from {student[1]}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return [name, house]\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNote that lists are mutable. That is, the order of house and name can be switched by a programmer. You might decide to utilize this in some cases where you want to provide more flexibility at the cost of the security of your code. After all, if the order of those values is changeable, programmers that work with you could make mistakes down the road.\nA dictionary could also be utilized in this implementation. Recall that dictionaries provide a key-value pair.\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(f\"{student['name']} from {student['house']}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    student = {}\n    student[\"name\"] = input(\"Name: \")\n    student[\"house\"] = input(\"House: \")\n    return student\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice in this case, two key-value pairs are returned. An advantage of this approach is that we can index into this dictionary using the keys.\nStill, our code can be further improved. Notice that there is an unneeded variable. We can remove student = {} because we don’t need to create an empty dictionary.\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(f\"{student['name']} from {student['house']}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return {\"name\": name, \"house\": house}\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice we can utilize {} braces in the return statement to create the dictionary and return it all in the same line.\nWe can provide our special case with Padma in our dictionary version of our code.\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    if student[\"name\"] == \"Padma\":\n        student[\"house\"] = \"Ravenclaw\"\n    print(f\"{student['name']} from {student['house']}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return {\"name\": name, \"house\": house}\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how, similar in spirit to our previous iterations of this code, we can utilize the key names to index into our student dictionary.",

    "text": "Classes\n\nClasses are a way by which, in object-oriented programming, we can create our own type of data and give them names.\nA class is like a mold for a type of data – where we can invent our own data type and give them a name.\nWe can modify our code as follows to implement our own class called Student:\nclass Student:\n    ...\n\n\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(f\"{student.name} from {student.house}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    student = Student()\n    student.name = input(\"Name: \")\n    student.house = input(\"House: \")\n    return student\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice by convention that Student is capitalized. Further, notice the ... simply means that we will later return to finish that portion of our code. Further, notice that in get_student, we can create a student of class Student using the syntax student = Student(). Further, notice that we utilize “dot notation” to access attributes of this variable student of class Student.\nAny time you create a class and you utilize that blueprint to create something, you create what is called an “object” or an “instance”. In the case of our code, student is an object.\nFurther, we can lay some groundwork for the attributes that are expected inside an object whose class is Student. We can modify our code as follows:\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, house):\n        self.name = name\n        self.house = house\n\n\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(f\"{student.name} from {student.house}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    student = Student(name, house)\n    return student\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice that within Student, we standardize the attributes of this class. We can create a function within class Student, called a “method”, that determines the behavior of an object of class Student. Within this function, it takes the name and house passed to it and assigns these variables to this object. Further, notice how the constructor student = Student(name, house) calls this function within the Student class and creates a student. self refers to the current object that was just created.\nWe can simplify our code as follows:\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, house):\n        self.name = name\n        self.house = house\n\n\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(f\"{student.name} from {student.house}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return Student(name, house)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how return Student(name, house) simplifies the previous iteration of our code where the constructor statement was run on its own line.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of classes.",

What if someone tries to type in something random? What if someone tries to create a student without a name? Modify your code as follows:\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, house):\n        if not name:\n            raise ValueError(\"Missing name\")\n        if house not in [\"Gryffindor\", \"Hufflepuff\", \"Ravenclaw\", \"Slytherin\"]:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid house\")\n        self.name = name\n        self.house = house\n\n\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(f\"{student.name} from {student.house}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return Student(name, house)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how we check now that a name is provided and a proper house is designated. It turns out we can create our own exceptions that alerts the programmer to a potential error created by the user called raise. In the case above, we raise ValueError with a specific error message.\nIt just so happens that Python allows you to create a specific function by which you can print the attributes of an object. Modify your code as follows:\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, house, patronus):\n        if not name:\n            raise ValueError(\"Missing name\")\n        if house not in [\"Gryffindor\", \"Hufflepuff\", \"Ravenclaw\", \"Slytherin\"]:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid house\")\n        self.name = name\n        self.house = house\n        self.patronus = patronus\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.name} from {self.house}\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(student)\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    patronus = input(\"Patronus: \")\n    return Student(name, house, patronus)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how def __str__(self) provides a means by which a student is returned when called. Therefore, you can now, as the programmer, print an object, its attributes, or almost anything you desire related to that object.\n__str__ is a built-in method that comes with Python classes. It just so happens that we can create our own methods for a class as well! Modify your code as follows:\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, house, patronus=None):\n        if not name:\n            raise ValueError(\"Missing name\")\n        if house not in [\"Gryffindor\", \"Hufflepuff\", \"Ravenclaw\", \"Slytherin\"]:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid house\")\n        if patronus and patronus not in [\"Stag\", \"Otter\", \"Jack Russell terrier\"]:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid patronus\")\n        self.name = name\n        self.house = house\n        self.patronus = patronus\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.name} from {self.house}\"\n\n    def charm(self):\n        match self.patronus:\n            case \"Stag\":\n                return \"🐴\"\n            case \"Otter\":\n                return \"🦦\"\n            case \"Jack Russell terrier\":\n                return \"🐶\"\n            case _:\n                return \"🪄\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(\"Expecto Patronum!\")\n    print(student.charm())\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    patronus = input(\"Patronus: \") or None\n    return Student(name, house, patronus)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how we define our own method charm. Unlike dictionaries, classes can have built-in functions called methods. In this case, we define our charm method where specific cases have specific results. Further, notice that Python has the ability to utilize emojis directly in our code.\nBefore moving forward, let us remove our patronus code. Modify your code as follows:\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, house):\n        if not name:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid name\")\n        if house not in [\"Gryffindor\", \"Hufflepuff\", \"Ravenclaw\", \"Slytherin\"]:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid house\")\n        self.name = name\n        self.house = house\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.name} from {self.house}\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    student.house = \"Number Four, Privet Drive\"\n    print(student)\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return Student(name, house)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how we have only two methods: __init__ and __str__.",

    "text": "Decorators\n\nProperties can be utilized to harden our code. In Python, we define properties using function “decorators”, which begin with @.

Doing so defines house as a property of our class. With house as a property, we gain the ability to define how some attribute of our class, _house, should be set and retrieved. Indeed, we can now define a function called a “setter”, via @house.setter, which will be called whenever the house property is set—for example, with student.house = \"Gryffindor\". Here, we’ve made our setter validate values of house for us. Notice how we raise a ValueError if the value of house is not any of the Harry Potter houses, otherwise, we’ll use house to update the value of _house. Why _house and not house? house is a property of our class, with functions via which a user attempts to set our class attribute. _house is that class attribute itself. The leading underscore, _, indicates to users they need not (and indeed, shouldn’t!) modify this value directly. _house should only be set through the house setter. Notice how the house property simply returns that value of _house, our class attribute that has presumably been validated using our house setter. When a user calls student.house, they’re getting the value of _house through our house “getter”.\nIn addition to the name of the house, we can protect the name of our student as well. Modify your code as follows:\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, house):\n        self.name = name\n        self.house = house\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.name} from {self.house}\"\n\n    # Getter for name\n    @property\n    def name(self):\n        return self._name\n\n    # Setter for name\n    @name.setter\n    def name(self, name):\n        if not name:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid name\")\n        self._name = name\n\n    @property\n    def house(self):\n        return self._house\n\n    @house.setter\n    def house(self, house):\n        if house not in [\"Gryffindor\", \"Hufflepuff\", \"Ravenclaw\", \"Slytherin\"]:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid house\")\n        self._house = house\n\n\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(student)\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return Student(name, house)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how, much like the previous code, we provide a getter and setter for the name.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of methods.",

The code above assigns that opened file to a variable called file. The line file.write(name) writes the name to the text file. The line after that closes the file.\nTesting out your code by typing python names.py, you can input a name and it saves to the text file. However, if you run your program multiple times using different names, you will notice that this program will entirely rewrite the names.txt file each time.\nIdeally, we want to be able to append each of our names to the file.

    "section": "CSV",
    "text": "CSV\n\nCSV stands for “comma separated values”.\nIn your terminal window, type code students.csv. Ensure your new CSV file looks like the following:\nHermione,Gryffindor\nHarry,Gryffindor\nRon,Gryffindor\nDraco,Slytherin\nLet’s create a new program by typing code students.py and code as follows:\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        row = line.rstrip().split(\",\")\n        print(f\"{row[0]} is in {row[1]}\")\nNotice that rstrip removes the end of each line in our CSV file. split tells the interpreter where to find the end of each of our values in our CSV file. row[0] is the first element in each line of our CSV file. row[1] is the second element in each line in our CSV file.\nThe above code is effective at dividing each line or “record” of our CSV file. However, it’s a bit cryptic to look at if you are unfamiliar with this type of syntax. Python has built-in ability that could further simplify this code. Modify your code as follows:\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        name, house = line.rstrip().split(\",\")\n        print(f\"{name} is in {house}\")\nNotice that the split function actually returns two values: The one before the comma and the one after the comma. Accordingly, we can rely upon that functionality to assign two variables at once instead of one!\nImagine that we would again like to provide this list as sorted output? You can modify your code as follows:\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        name, house = line.rstrip().split(\",\")\n        students.append(f\"{name} is in {house}\")\n\nfor student in sorted(students):\n    print(student)\nNotice that we create a list called students. We append each string to this list. Then, we output a sorted version of our list.\nRecall that Python allows for dictionaries where a key can be associated with a value. This code could be further improved\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        name, house = line.rstrip().split(\",\")\n        student = {}\n        student[\"name\"] = name\n        student[\"house\"] = house\n        students.append(student)\n\nfor student in students:\n    print(f\"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}\")\nNotice that we create an empty dictionary called student. We add the values for each student, including their name and house into the student dictionary. Then, we append that student to the list called students.\nWe can improve our code to illustrate this as follows:\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        name, house = line.rstrip().split(\",\")\n        student = {\"name\": name, \"house\": house}\n        students.append(student)\n\nfor student in students:\n    print(f\"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}\")\nNotice that this produces the desired outcome, minus the sorting of students.\nUnfortunately, we cannot sort the students as we had prior because each student is now a dictionary inside of a list. It would be helpful if Python could sort the students list of student dictionaries that sorts this list of dictionaries by the student’s name.\nTo implement this in our code, make the following changes:\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        name, house = line.rstrip().split(\",\")\n        students.append({\"name\": name, \"house\": house})\n\n\ndef get_name(student):\n    return student[\"name\"]\n\n\nfor student in sorted(students, key=get_name):\n    print(f\"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}\")\nNotice that sorted needs to know how to get the key of each student. Python allows for a parameter called key where we can define on what “key” the list of students will be sorted. Therefore, the get_name function simply returns the key of student[\"name\"]. Running this program, you will now see that the list is now sorted by name.\nStill, our code can be further improved upon. It just so happens that if you are only going to use a function like get_name once, you can simplify your code in the manner presented below. Modify your code as follows:\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        name, house = line.rstrip().split(\",\")\n        students.append({\"name\": name, \"house\": house})\n\nfor student in sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[\"name\"]):\n    print(f\"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}\")\nNotice how we use a lambda function, an anonymous function, that says “Hey Python, here is a function that has no name: Given a student, access their name and return that to the key.\nUnfortunately, our code is a bit fragile. Suppose that we changed our CSV file such that we indicated where each student grew up. What would be the impact of this upon our program? First, modify your students.csv file as follows:\n\nHarry,\"Number Four, Privet Drive\"\nRon,The Burrow\nDraco,Malfoy Manor\nNotice how running our program how will produce a number of errors.\n\nNow that we’re dealing with homes instead of houses, modify your code as follows:\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        name, home = line.rstrip().split(\",\")\n        students.append({\"name\": name, \"home\": home})\n\nfor student in sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[\"name\"]):\n    print(f\"{student['name']} is in {student['home']}\")\nNotice that running our program still does not work properly. Can you guess why?\nThe ValueError: too many values to unpack error produced by the interpreter is a result of the fact that we previously created this program expecting the CSV file is split using a , (comma). We could spend more time addressing this, but indeed someone else has already developed a way to “parse” (that is, to read) CSV files!\nPython’s built-in csv library comes with an object called a reader. As the name suggests, we can use a reader to read our CSV file despite the extra comma in “Number Four, Privet Drive”. A reader works in a for loop, where each iteration the reader gives us another row from our CSV file. This row itself is a list, where each value in the list corresponds to an element in that row. row[0], for example, is the first element of the given row, while row[1] is the second element.\nimport csv\n\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    reader = csv.reader(file)\n    for row in reader:\n        students.append({\"name\": row[0], \"home\": row[1]})\n\nfor student in sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[\"name\"]):\n    print(f\"{student['name']} is from {student['home']}\")\nNotice that our program now works as expected.\nUp until this point, we have been relying upon our program to specifically decide what parts of our CSV file are the names and what parts are the homes. It’s better design, though, to bake this directly into our CSV file by editing it as follows:\nname,home\nHarry,\"Number Four, Privet Drive\"\nRon,The Burrow\nDraco,Malfoy Manor\nNotice how we are explicitly saying in our CSV file that anything reading it should expect there to be a name value and a home value in each line.\nWe can modify our code to use a part of the csv library called a DictReader to treat our CSV file with even more flexibilty:\nimport csv\n\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n    for row in reader:\n        students.append({\"name\": row[\"name\"], \"home\": row[\"home\"]})\n\nfor student in sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[\"name\"]):\n    print(f\"{student['name']} is in {student['home']}\")\nNotice that we have replaced reader with DictReader, which returns one dictionary at a time. Also, notice that the interpreter will directly access the row dictionary, getting the name and home of each student. This is an example of coding defensively. As long as the person designing the CSV file has inputted the correct header information on the first line, we can access that information using our program.\nUp until this point, we have been reading CSV files. What if we want to write to a CSV file?\nTo begin, let’s clean up our files a bit. First, delete the students.csv file by typing rm students.csv in the terminal window. This command will only work if you’re in the same folder as your students.csv file.\nThen, in students.py, modify your code as follows:\nimport csv\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nhome = input(\"Where's your home? \")\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\", \"a\") as file:\n    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=[\"name\", \"home\"])\n    writer.writerow({\"name\": name, \"home\": home})\nNotice how we are leveraging the built-in functionality of DictWriter, which takes two parameters: the file being written to and the fieldnames to write. Further, notice how the writerow function takes a dictionary as its parameter. Quite literally, we are telling the interpreter to write a row with two fields called name and home.\nNote that there are many types of files that you can read from and write to.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of CSV.",

Prior, our import line of code is bringing the entire contents of the functions of random. However, what if we want to only load a small part of a module? Modify your code as follows:\nfrom random import choice\n\ncoin = choice([\"heads\", \"tails\"])\nprint(coin)\nNotice that we now can import just the choice function of random. From that point forward, we no longer need to code random.choice. We can now only code choice alone. choice is loaded explicitly into our program. This saves system resources and potentially can make our code run faster!\nMoving on, consider the function random.randint(a, b). This function will generate a random number between a and b. Modify your code as follows:\nimport random\n\nnumber = random.randint(1, 10)\nprint(number)\nNotice that our code will randomly generate a number between 1 and 10.\nWe can introduce the function random.shuffle(x), which shuffles a list into a random order.\nimport random\n\ncards = [\"jack\", \"queen\", \"king\"]\nrandom.shuffle(cards)\nfor card in cards:\n    print(card)\nNotice that random.shuffle will shuffle the cards in place. Unlike other functions, it will not return a value. Instead, it will take the cards list and shuffle them inside that list. Run your code a few times to see the code functioning.\nWe now have these three ways above to generate random information.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of random.",

In the terminal window, type code name.py. In the text editor, code as follows:\nimport sys\n\nprint(\"hello, my name is\", sys.argv[1])\nNotice that the program is going to look at what the user typed in the command line. Currently, if you type python name.py David into the terminal window, you will see hello, my name is David. Notice that sys.argv[1] is where David is being stored. Why is that? Well, in prior lessons, you might remember that lists start at the 0th element. What do you think is held currently in sys.argv[0]? If you guessed name.py, you would be correct!\nThere is a small problem with our program as it stands. What if the user does not type in the name at the command line? Try it yourself. Type python name.py into the terminal window. An error list index out of range will be presented by the interpreter. The reason for this is that there is nothing at sys.argv[1] because nothing was typed! Here’s how we can protect our program from this type of error:\nimport sys\n\ntry:\n    print(\"hello, my name is\", sys.argv[1])\nexcept IndexError:\n    print(\"Too few arguments\")\nNotice that the user will now be prompted with a useful hint about how to make the program work if they forget to type in a name. However, could we be more defensive to ensure the user inputs the right values?\nOur program can be improved as follows:\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:\n    print(\"Too few arguments\")\nelif len(sys.argv) &gt; 2:\n    print(\"Too many arguments\")\nelse:\n    print(\"hello, my name is\", sys.argv[1])\nNotice how if you test your code, you will see how these exceptions are handled, providing the user with more refined advice. Even if the user types in too many or too few arguments, the user is provided clear instructions about how to fix the issue.\nRight now, our code is logically correct. However, there is something very nice about keeping our error checking separate from the remainder of our code. How could we separate out our error handling? Modify your code as follows:\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:\n    sys.exit(\"Too few arguments\")\nelif len(sys.argv) &gt; 2:\n    sys.exit(\"Too many arguments\")\n\nprint(\"hello, my name is\", sys.argv[1])\nNotice how we are using a built-in function of sys called exit that allows us to exit the program if an error was introduced by the user. We can rest assured now that the program will never execute the final line of code and trigger an error. Therefore, sys.argv provides a way by which users can introduce information from the command line. sys.exit provides a means by which the program can exit if an error arises.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of sys.",

In your internet browser, you can visit https://itunes.apple.com/search?entity=song&limit=1&term=weezer and a text file will be downloaded. David constructed this URL by reading Apple’s API documentation. Notice how this query is looking for a song, with a limit of one result, that relates to the term called weezer. Looking at this text file that is downloaded, you might find the format to be similar to that we’ve programmed previously in Python.\nThe format in the downloaded text file is called JSON, a text-based format that is used to exchange text-based data between applications. Literally, Apple is providing a JSON file that we could interpret in our own Python program.\nIn the terminal window, type code itunes.py. Code as follows:\nimport requests\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 2:\n    sys.exit()\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://itunes.apple.com/search?entity=song&limit=1&term=\" + sys.argv[1])\nprint(response.json())\nNotice how the returned value of requests.get will be stored in response. David, having read the Apple documentation about this API, knows that what is returned is a JSON file. Running python itunes.py weezer, you will see the JSON file returned by Apple. However, the JSON response is converted by Python into a dictionary. Looking at the output, it can be quite dizzying!\nIt turns out that Python has a built-in JSON library that can help us interpret the data received. Modify your code as follows:\nimport json\nimport requests\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 2:\n    sys.exit()\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://itunes.apple.com/search?entity=song&limit=1&term=\" + sys.argv[1])\nprint(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))\nNotice that json.dumps is implemented such that it utilizes indent to make the output more readable. Running python itunes.py weezer, you will see the same JSON file. However, this time, it is much more readable. Notice now that you will see a dictionary called results inside the output. Inside that dictionary called results there are numerous keys present. Look at the trackName value in the output. What track name do you see in your results?\nHow could we simply output the name of just that track name?

Then, we are iterating through the results in o and printing each trackName. Also notice how we have increased the limit number of results to 50. Run your program. See the results.\nYou can learn more about requests through the library’s documentation.\nYou can learn more about JSON in Python’s documentation of JSON.",

It will loop forever. while loops work by repeatedly asking if the condition of the loop has been fulfilled. In this case, the interpreter is asking, “does i not equal zero?” When you get stuck in a loop that executes forever, you can press Ctrl+C on your keyboard to break out of the loop.\nTo fix this loop that lasts forever, we can edit our code as follows\ni = 3\nwhile i != 0:\n  print(\"meow\")\n  i = i - 1\nNotice that now our code executes properly, reducing i by 1 for each “iteration” through the loop. The term iteration has special significance within coding. By iteration, we mean one cycle through the loop. The first iteration is the “0th” iteration through the loop. The second is the “1st” iteration. In programming, we count starting with 0, then 1, then 2.\nWe can further improve our code as follows:\n  i = 1\n  while i &lt;= 3:\n      print(\"meow\")\n      i = i + 1\nNotice that when we code i = i + 1 we assign the value of i from the right to the left. Above, we are starting i at one, like most humans count (1, 2, 3). If you execute the code above, you’ll see it meows three times. It’s best practice in programming to begin counting with zero.\nWe can improve our code to start counting with zero:\ni = 0\nwhile i &lt; 3:\n    print(\"meow\")\n    i += 1\nNotice how changing the operator to i &lt; 3 allows our code to function as intended. We begin by counting with 0 and it iterates through our loop three times, producing three meows. Also, notice how i += 1 is the same as saying i = i + 1.\nOur code at this point is illustrated as follows:\nflowchart TD\n  A([start]) --&gt; B[i = 0]\n  B --&gt; C{i &lt; 3}\n  C -- True --&gt; D[\"#quot;meow#quot;\"]\n  D --&gt; E[i += 1]\n  E --&gt; C\n  C -- False --&gt; F([stop])\nNotice how our loop counts i up to, but not through 3.",

    "section": "For Loops",
    "text": "For Loops\n\nA for loop is a different type of loop.\nTo best understand a for loop, it’s best to begin by talking about a new variable type called a list in Python. As in other areas of our lives, we can have a grocery list, a to-do list, etc.\nA for loop iterates through a list of items. For example, in the text editor window, modify your cat.py code as follows:\nfor i in [0, 1, 2]:\n    print(\"meow\")\nNotice how clean this code is compared to your previous while loop code. In this code, i begins with 0, meows, i is assigned 1, meows, and, finally, i is assigned 2, meows, and then ends.\nWhile this code accomplishes what we want, there are some possibilities for improving our code for extreme cases. At first glance, our code looks great. However, what if you wanted to iterate up to a million? It’s best to create code that can work with such extreme cases. Accordingly, we can improve our code as follows:\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(\"meow\")\nNotice how range(3) provides back three values (0, 1, and 2) automatically. This code will execute and produce the intended effect, meowing three times.\nOur code can be further improved. Notice how we never use i explicitly in our code. That is, while Python needs the i as a place to store the number of the iteration of the loop, we never use it for any other purpose. In Python, if such a variable does not have any other significance in our code, we can simply represent this variable as a single underscore _. Therefore, you can modify your code as follows:\nfor _ in range(3):\n    print(\"meow\")\nNotice how changing the i to _ has zero impact on the functioning of our program.\nOur code can be further improved. To stretch your mind to the possibilities within Python, consider the following code:\nprint(\"meow\" * 3)\nNotice how it will meow three times, but the program will produce meowmeowmeow as the result. Consider: How could you create a line break at the end of each meow?\nIndeed, you can edit your code as follows:\nprint(\"meow\\n\" * 3, end=\"\")\nNotice how this code produces three meows, each on a separate line. By adding end=\"\" and the \\n we tell the interpreter to add a line break at the end of each meow.",

    "text": "Improving with User Input\n\nPerhaps we want to get input from our user. We can use loops as a way of validating the input of the user.\nA common paradigm within Python is to use a while loop to validate the input of the user.\nFor example, let’s try prompting the user for a number greater than or equal to 0:\nwhile True:\n    n = int(input(\"What's n? \"))\n    if n &lt; 0:\n        continue\n    else:\n        break\nNotice that we’ve introduced two new keywords in Python, continue and break. continue explicitly tells Python to go to the next iteration of a loop. break, on the other hand, tells Python to “break out” of a loop early before it has finished all of its iterations. In this case, we’ll continue to the next iteration of the loop when n is less than 0—ultimately reprompting the user with “What’s n?”. If, though, n is greater than or equal to 0, we’ll break out of the loop and allow the rest of our program to run.\nIt turns out that the continue keyword is redundant in this case. We can improve our code as follows:\nwhile True:\n    n = int(input(\"What's n? \"))\n    if n &gt; 0:\n        break\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    print(\"meow\")\nNotice how this while loop will always run (forever) until n is greater than 0. When n is greater than 0, the loop breaks.\nBringing in our prior learning, we can use functions to further improve our code:\ndef main():\n    meow(get_number())\n\n\ndef get_number():\n    while True:\n        n = int(input(\"What's n? \"))\n        if n &gt; 0:\n            return n\n\n\ndef meow(n):\n    for _ in range(n):\n        print(\"meow\")\n\n\nmain()\nNotice how not only did we change your code to operate in multiple functions, but we also used a return statement to return the value of n back to the main function.",

How could we print out both values and keys?\nModify your code as follows:\nstudents = {\n    \"Hermione\": \"Gryffindor\",\n    \"Harry\": \"Gryffindor\",\n    \"Ron\": \"Gryffindor\",\n    \"Draco\": \"Slytherin\",\n}\nfor student in students:\n    print(student, students[student])\nNotice how students[student] will go to each student’s key and find the value of their house. Execute your code, and you’ll notice how the output is a bit messy.\nWe can clean up the print function by improving our code as follows:\nstudents = {\n    \"Hermione\": \"Gryffindor\",\n    \"Harry\": \"Gryffindor\",\n    \"Ron\": \"Gryffindor\",\n    \"Draco\": \"Slytherin\",\n}\nfor student in students:\n    print(student, students[student], sep=\", \")\nNotice how this creates a clean separation of a , between each item printed.\nIf you execute python hogwarts.py, you should see the following:\n$ python hogwarts.py\nHermione, Gryffindor\nHarry, Gryffindor\nRon, Gryffindor\nDraco, Slytherin\nWhat if we have more information about our students? How could we associate more data with each of the students?\n\n\n\nHarry Potter Names.\n\n\nYou can imagine wanting to have lots of data associated with multiple keys. Enhance your code as follows:\nstudents = [\n    {\"name\": \"Hermione\", \"house\": \"Gryffindor\", \"patronus\": \"Otter\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Harry\", \"house\": \"Gryffindor\", \"patronus\": \"Stag\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Ron\", \"house\": \"Gryffindor\", \"patronus\": \"Jack Russell terrier\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Draco\", \"house\": \"Slytherin\", \"patronus\": None},\n]\nNotice how this code creates a list of dicts. The list called students has four dicts within it: One for each student. Also, notice that Python has a special None designation where there is no value associated with a key.\nNow, you have access to a whole host of interesting data about these students. Now, further modify your code as follows:\nstudents = [\n    {\"name\": \"Hermione\", \"house\": \"Gryffindor\", \"patronus\": \"Otter\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Harry\", \"house\": \"Gryffindor\", \"patronus\": \"Stag\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Ron\", \"house\": \"Gryffindor\", \"patronus\": \"Jack Russell terrier\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Draco\", \"house\": \"Slytherin\", \"patronus\": None},\n]\n\nfor student in students:\n    print(student[\"name\"], student[\"house\"], student[\"patronus\"], sep=\", \")\nNotice how the for loop will iterate through each of the dicts inside the list called students.\nYou can learn more in Python’s Documentation of dicts.",

For that, we will need to introduce you to variables\n\n\nVariables\n\nA variable is just a container for a value within your own program.\nIn your program, you can introduce your own variable in your program by editing it to read\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(\"hello, world\")\nNotice that this equal = sign in the middle of name = input(\"What's your name? \") has a special role in programming. This equal sign literally assigns what is on the right to what is on the left. Therefore, the value returned by input(\"What's your name? \") is assigned to name.\nIf you edit your code as follows, you will notice an unexpected result:\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(\"hello, name\")\nThe program will return hello, name in the terminal window regardless of what the user types.\nFurther editing our code, you could type\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(\"hello,\")\nprint(name)\nThe result in the terminal window would be\nWhat's your name?

You might edit your code as follows:\n# Ask the user for their name\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(\"hello,\")\nprint(name)\nComments can also serve as a to-do list for you.\n\n\n\nPseudocode\n\nPseudocode is an important type of comment that becomes a special type of to-do list, especially when you don’t understand how to accomplish a coding task.

If we look at the documentation for print you’ll notice we can learn a lot about the arguments that the print function takes.\nLooking at this documentation, you’ll learn that the print function automatically includes the argument end='\\n'. This \\n indicates that the print function will automatically create a line break when run. The function takes an argument called end, and the default is to create a new line.\nHowever, we can technically provide an argument for end ourselves such that a new line is not created!\nWe can modify our code as follows:\n# Ask the user for their name\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(\"hello,\", end=\"\")\nprint(name)\nBy providing end=\"\" we are overwriting the default value of end such that it never creates a new line after this first print statement.

Why might this be?\nPrior, we have seen how the + sign concatenates two strings. Because your input from your keyboard on your computer comes into the interpreter as text, it is treated as a string. We, therefore, need to convert this input from a string to an integer. We can do so as follows:\nx = input(\"What's x? \")\ny = input(\"What's y? \")\n\nz = int(x) + int(y)\n\nprint(z)\nThe result is now correct. The use of int(x) is called “casting,” where a value is temporarily changed from one type of variable (in this case, a string) to another (here, an integer).\nWe can further improve our program as follows:\nx = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\ny = int(input(\"What's y? \"))\n\nprint(x + y)\nThis illustrates that you can run functions on functions.

Therefore, when you call hello(name) the computer passes name into the hello function as to. This is how we pass values into functions. Very useful! Running python hello.py in the terminal window, you’ll see that the output is much closer to our ideal presented earlier in this lecture.\nWe can change our code to add a default value to hello:\n# Create our own function\ndef hello(to=\"world\"):\n    print(\"hello,\", to)\n\n\n# Output using our own function\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nhello(name)\n\n# Output without passing the expected arguments\nhello()\nTest out your code yourself. Notice how the first hello will behave as you might expect, and the second hello, which is not passed a value, will, by default, output hello, world.\nWe don’t have to have our function at the start of our program. We can move it down, but we need to tell the interpreter that we have a main function and a separate hello function.\ndef main():\n\n    # Output using our own function\n    name = input(\"What's your name? \")\n    hello(name)\n\n    # Output without passing the expected arguments\n    hello()\n\n\n# Create our own function\ndef hello(to=\"world\"):\n    print(\"hello,\", to)\nThis alone, however, will create an error of sorts. If we run python hello.py, nothing happens! The reason for this is that nothing in this code is actually calling the main function and bringing our program to life.\nThe following very small modification will call the main function and restore our program to working order:\ndef main():\n\n    # Output using our own function\n    name = input(\"What's your name? \")\n    hello(name)\n\n    # Output without passing the expected arguments\n    hello()\n\n\n# Create our own function\ndef hello(to=\"world\"):\n    print(\"hello,\", to)\n\n\nmain()",

    "text": "Returning Values\n\nYou can imagine many scenarios where you don’t just want a function to perform an action but also to return a value back to the main function. For example, rather than simply printing the calculation of x + y, you may want a function to return the value of this calculation back to another part of your program. This “passing back” of a value we call a return value.\nReturning to our calculator.py code by typing code calculator.py. Erase all code there. Rework the code as follows:\ndef main():\n    x = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\n    print(\"x squared is\", square(x))\n\n\ndef square(n):\n    return n * n\n\n\nmain()\nEffectively, x is passed to square.

Finally, each query should return only the data necessary to answer the question: if the problem only asks you to output the names of movies, for example, then your query should not also output each movie’s release year.\nYou’re welcome to check your queries’ results against IMDb itself, but realize that ratings on the website might differ from those in movies.db, as more votes might have been cast since we downloaded the data!\n\nIn 1.sql, write a SQL query to list the titles of all movies released in 2008.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column for the title of each movie.\n\nIn 2.sql, write a SQL query to determine the birth year of Emma Stone.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column and a single row (not counting the header) containing Emma Stone’s birth year.\nYou may assume that there is only one person in the database with the name Emma Stone.\n\nIn 3.sql, write a SQL query to list the titles of all movies with a release date on or after 2018, in alphabetical order.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column for the title of each movie.\nMovies released in 2018 should be included, as should movies with release dates in the future.\n\nIn 4.sql, write a SQL query to determine the number of movies with an IMDb rating of 10.0.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column and a single row (not counting the header) containing the number of movies with a 10.0 rating.\n\nIn 5.sql, write a SQL query to list the titles and release years of all Harry Potter movies, in chronological order.\n\nYour query should output a table with two columns, one for the title of each movie and one for the release year of each movie.\nYou may assume that the title of all Harry Potter movies will begin with the words “Harry Potter”, and that if a movie title begins with the words “Harry Potter”, it is a Harry Potter movie.\n\nIn 6.sql, write a SQL query to determine the average rating of all movies released in 2012.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column and a single row (not counting the header) containing the average rating.\n\nIn 7.sql, write a SQL query to list all movies released in 2010 and their ratings, in descending order by rating. For movies with the same rating, order them alphabetically by title.\n\nYour query should output a table with two columns, one for the title of each movie and one for the rating of each movie.\nMovies that do not have ratings should not be included in the result.\n\nIn 8.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all people who starred in Toy Story.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column for the name of each person.\nYou may assume that there is only one movie in the database with the title Toy Story.\n\nIn 9.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all people who starred in a movie released in 2004, ordered by birth year.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column for the name of each person.\nPeople with the same birth year may be listed in any order.\nNo need to worry about people who have no birth year listed, so long as those who do have a birth year are listed in order.\nIf a person appeared in more than one movie in 2004, they should only appear in your results once.\n\nIn 10.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all people who have directed a movie that received a rating of at least 9.0.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column for the name of each person.\nIf a person directed more than one movie that received a rating of at least 9.0, they should only appear in your results once.\n\nIn 11.sql, write a SQL query to list the titles of the five highest rated movies (in order) that Chadwick Boseman starred in, starting with the highest rated.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column for the title of each movie.\nYou may assume that there is only one person in the database with the name Chadwick Boseman.\n\nIn 12.sql, write a SQL query to list the titles of all movies in which both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence starred.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column for the title of each movie.\nYou may assume that there is only one person in the database with the name Bradley Cooper.\nYou may assume that there is only one person in the database with the name Jennifer Lawrence.\n\nIn 13.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all people who starred in a movie in which Kevin Bacon also starred.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column for the name of each person.\nThere may be multiple people named Kevin Bacon in the database. Be sure to only select the Kevin Bacon born in 1958.\nKevin Bacon himself should not be included in the resulting list.\n\n\nHints\nUnderstand the schema of movies.db\nWhenever you engage with a new database, it’s best to first understand its schema. In a terminal window, run sqlite3 movies.db so that you can begin executing queries on the database.\nFirst, when sqlite3 prompts you to provide a query, type .schema and press enter. This will output the CREATE TABLE statements that were used to generate each of the tables in the database. By examining those statements, you can identify the columns present in each table.\nNotice that the movies table has an id column that uniquely identifies each movie, as well as columns for the title of a movie and the year in which the movie was released. The people table also has an id column, and also has columns for each person’s name and birth year.\nMovie ratings, meanwhile, are stored in the ratings table. The first column in the table is movie_id: a foreign key that references the id of the movies table. The rest of the row contains data about the rating for each movie and the number of votes the movie has received on IMDb.\nFinally, the stars and directors tables match people to the movies in which they acted or directed. (Only principal stars and directors are included.) Each table has just two columns: movie_id and person_id, which reference a specific movie and person, respectively.\nThe challenge ahead of you is to write SQL queries to answer a variety of different questions by selecting data from one or more of these tables.\nConsistently style your queries\nSee sqlstyle.guide for pointers on good style in SQL, especially as your queries get more complex!\nList the titles of all movies released in 2008\nRecall that you can select one (or more) columns from a database using SELECT, per the example below,\nSELECT column0, column1 FROM table;\nwhere column0 is the title of one column, and column1 is the title of another.\nAnd recall that you can filter the rows returned in a query with the WHERE keyword, followed by a condition. You can use =, &gt;, &lt;, and other operators too.\nSELECT column FROM table\nWHERE condition;\nSee this SQL keywords reference for some SQL syntax that may be helpful!\nDetermine the birth year of Emma Stone\nRecall that a WHERE clause can evaluate conditions not just with numbers, but with strings.\nList the titles of all movies with a release date on or after 2018, in alphabetical order\nTry breaking this query into two steps. First, find the movies with a release date on or after 2018. Then, put those movies’ titles in alphabetical order.\nTo find the movies with a release date on or after 2018, recall that a condition in SQL supports the use of many common comparison operators, including &gt;= for “greater than or equal to.” Check to see if your query returns the correct number of movies, per How to Test.\nFinally, sort the query’s results alphabetically by title. Recall that ORDER BY can sort data by a column in your results, per the example below.\n...\nORDER BY column;\nDetermine the number of movies with an IMDb rating of 10.0\nNotice this question asks you not for individual movies with a rating of 10.0, but for the number of movies with such a rating. In other words, you should collect (“aggregate”) the results of your query into a single number (the number of rows). Recall that SQL supports an “aggregation function” called COUNT, which you can use on a column per the example below.\nSELECT COUNT(column)\nFROM table;\nList the titles and release years of all Harry Potter movies, in chronological order\nFor this query, you’ll likely want to make use of SQL’s LIKE keyword. Recall that LIKE can make use of so-called “wildcard characters”, such as %, that will match any character (or sequence thereof).\nSELECT column0, column1\nFROM table\nWHERE column1 LIKE pattern;\nDetermine the average rating of all movies released in 2012\nHere’s another example of a query in which you’ll need to aggregate data. Consider SQL’s AVG aggregation function, to compute an average.\nConsider, too, that this query makes use of data stored in two separate tables: ratings and movies. Recall that—so long as one table has a foreign key that matches a column in another table—you can combine two tables using SQL’s JOIN keyword. To use the JOIN keyword, you should specify the table you’d like to join and the column by which to do so.\nSELECT column0\nFROM table0\nJOIN table1 ON table0.column1 = table1.column2\nList all movies released in 2010 and their ratings, in descending order by rating\nRecall that ORDER BY need not always sort in ascending order. You can specify that your results be sorted in descending order by appending DESC.\n...\nORDER BY column DESC;\nList the names of all people who starred in Toy Story\nWhen you see a more complex query such as this one, it’s best to break it down into smaller pieces. Ultimately, your query should arrive at a list of names, per the below.\n-- Select names\nSELECT name\nFROM people\nWHERE ...\nBut how’s best to arrive at the names of those who starred in Toy Story? Consider that the people table alone doesn’t have this information (but the stars table might!). Indeed, the stars table combines two columns, person_id and movie_id: any person with a person_id that is associated with Toy Story’s movie_id starred in Toy Story.\n-- Select names\nSELECT name\nFROM people\nWHERE ...\n\n-- Select person IDs\nSELECT person_id\nFROM stars\nWHERE movie_id = ...\nA natural next step, then, is to find Toy Story’s movie ID.\n-- Select names\nSELECT name\nFROM people\nWHERE ...\n\n-- Select person IDs\nSELECT person_id\nFROM stars\nWHERE movie_id = ...\n\n-- Find Toy Story's ID\nSELECT id\nFROM movies\nWHERE title = 'Toy Story';\nOf course, you’ve presently written three separate queries. But notice that some queries (the first two) would be complete by including results of the query directly below them. The process of making a query that depends on the results of a “subquery” is called “nesting” queries. It’s quite the hint, but here’s one way to nest the above queries!\n-- Select names\nSELECT name\nFROM people\nWHERE id IN\n(\n    -- Select person IDs\n    SELECT person_id\n    FROM stars\n    WHERE movie_id = (\n\n        -- Select Toy Story's ID\n        SELECT id\n        FROM movies\n        WHERE title = 'Toy Story'\n    )\n);\nList the names of all people who starred in a movie released in 2004, ordered by birth year\nNotice that this query, like the previous, requires you to use data from multiple tables. Recall that you can “nest” queries in SQL, which allows you to break a larger query into smaller ones. Perhaps you could write queries to…\n\nFind the IDs of movies released in 2004\nFind the IDs of people who starred in those movies\nFind the names of people with those people IDs\n\nThen, try nesting those queries to arrive at a single query that returns all people who starred in a movie released in 2004. Consider how you might then order the results of your query.\nList the names of all people who have directed a movie that received a rating of at least 9.0\nNotice that this query, like the previous, requires you to use data from multiple tables. Recall that you can “nest” queries in SQL, which allows you to break a larger query into smaller ones. Perhaps you could write queries to…\n\nFind the IDs of movies with at least a 9.0 rating\nFind the IDs of people who directed those movies\nFind the names of people with those people IDs\n\nThen, try nesting those queries to arrive at a single query that returns the names of all people who have directed a movie that received a rating of at least 9.0.\nList the titles of the five highest rated movies (in order) that Chadwick Boseman starred in, starting with the highest rated\nNotice that this query, like the previous, requires you to use data from multiple tables. Recall that you can “nest” queries in SQL, which allows you to break a larger query into smaller ones. Perhaps you could write queries to…\n\nFind the ID of Chadwick Boseman\nFind the IDs of movies associated with Chadwick Boseman’s ID\nFind the movie titles with those movie IDs\n\nThen, try nesting those queries to arrive at a single query that returns the titles of Chadwick Boseman’s movies.\nFrom there, you’ll need to determine the ratings of those titles and sort those titles by rating, in descending order. Consider how you could combine a relevant table (likely ratings!) and order the results by a relevant column.\nFinally, read up on SQL’s LIMIT keyword, which will return the top (n) rows in a query.\nList the titles of all movies in which both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence starred\nNotice that this query, like the previous, requires you to use data from multiple tables. Recall that you can “nest” queries in SQL, which allows you to break a larger query into smaller ones. Perhaps you could write queries to…\n\nFind the ID of Bradley Cooper\nFind the ID of Jennifer Lawrence\nFind the IDs of movies associated with Bradley Cooper’s ID\nFind the IDs of movies associated with Jennifer Lawrence’s ID\nFind movie titles from the movie IDs associated with both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence\n\nThen, try nesting those queries to arrive at a single query that returns the movies in which both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence starred.\nRecall that you can build compound conditions in SQL using AND or OR.\nList the names of all people who starred in a movie in which Kevin Bacon also starred\nNotice that this query, like the previous, requires you to use data from multiple tables. Recall that you can “nest” queries in SQL, which allows you to break a larger query into smaller ones. Perhaps you could write queries to…\n\nFind the ID of Kevin Bacon (the one born in 1958!)\nFind the IDs of movies associated with Kevin Bacon’s ID\nFind the IDs of people associated with those movie IDs\nFind the names of people with those people IDs\n\nThen, try nesting those queries to arrive at a single query that returns the names of all people who starred in a movie in which Kevin Bacon also starred. Keep in mind that you’ll want to exclude Kevin Bacon himself from the results!"

    "text": "Advice\nUnderstand the code in inheritance.c\nTake a look at the distribution code in inheritance.c.\nNotice the definition of a type called person. Each person has an array of two parents, each of which is a pointer to another person struct. Each person also has an array of two alleles, each of which is a char (either 'A', 'B', or 'O').\n// Each person has two parents and two alleles\ntypedef struct person\n{\n    struct person *parents[2];\n    char alleles[2];\n}\nperson;\nNow, take a look at the main function. The function begins by “seeding” (i.e., providing some initial input to) a random number generator, which we’ll use later to generate random alleles.\n// Seed random number generator\nsrandom(time(0));\nThe main function then calls the create_family function to simulate the creation of person structs for a family of 3 generations (i.e. a person, their parents, and their grandparents).\n// Create a new family with three generations\nperson *p = create_family(GENERATIONS);\nWe then call print_family to print out each of those family members and their blood types.\n// Print family tree of blood types\nprint_family(p, 0);\nFinally, the function calls free_family to free any memory that was previously allocated with malloc.\n// Free memory\nfree_family(p);\nThe create_family and free_family functions are left to you to write!\nComplete the create_family function\nThe create_family function should return a pointer to a person who has inherited their blood type from the number of generations given as input.\n\nNotice first that this problem poses a good opportunity for recursion.\n\nTo determine the present person’s blood type, you need to first determine their parents’ blood types.\nTo determine those parents’ blood types, you must first determine their parents’ blood types. And so on until you reach the last generation you wish to simulate.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, you’ll find several TODOs in the distribution code.\nFirst, you should allocate memory for a new person. Recall that you can use malloc to allocate memory, and sizeof(person) to get the number of bytes to allocate.\n// Allocate memory for new person\nperson *new_person = malloc(sizeof(person));\nNext, you should check if there are still generations left to create: that is, whether generations &gt; 1.\nIf generations &gt; 1, then there are more generations that still need to be allocated. We’ve already created two new parents, parent0 and parent1, by recursively calling create_family. Your create_family function should then set the parent pointers of the new person you created. Finally, assign both alleles for the new person by randomly choosing one allele from each parent.\n\nRemember, to access a variable via a pointer, you can use arrow notation. For example, if p is a pointer to a person, then a pointer to this person’s first parent can be accessed by p-&gt;parents[0].\nYou might find the random() function useful for randomly assigning alleles. This function returns an integer between 0 and RAND_MAX, or 32767. In particular, to generate a pseudorandom number that is either 0 or 1, you can use the expression random() % 2.\n\n// Create two new parents for current person by recursively calling create_family\nperson *parent0 = create_family(generations - 1);\nperson *parent1 = create_family(generations - 1);\n\n// Set parent pointers for current person\nnew_person-&gt;parents[0] = parent0;\nnew_person-&gt;parents[1] = parent1;\n\n// Randomly assign current person's alleles based on the alleles of their parents\nnew_person-&gt;alleles[0] = parent0-&gt;alleles[random() % 2];\nnew_person-&gt;alleles[1] = parent1-&gt;alleles[random() % 2];\nLet’s say there are no more generations left to simulate. That is, generations == 1. If so, there will be no parent data for this person. Both parents of your new person should be set to NULL, and each allele should be generated randomly.\n// Set parent pointers to NULL\nnew_person-&gt;parents[0] = NULL;\nnew_person-&gt;parents[1] = NULL;\n\n// Randomly assign alleles\nnew_person-&gt;alleles[0] = random_allele();\nnew_person-&gt;alleles[1] = random_allele();\nFinally, your function should return a pointer for the person that was allocated.\n// Return newly created person\nreturn new_person;\nComplete the free_family function\nThe free_family function should accept as input a pointer to a person, free memory for that person, and then recursively free memory for all of their ancestors.\n\nSince this is a recursive function, you should first handle the base case. If the input to the function is NULL, then there’s nothing to free, so your function can return immediately.\nOtherwise, you should recursively free both of the person’s parents before freeing the child.\n\nThe below is quite the hint, but here’s how to do just that!\n// Free `p` and all ancestors of `p`.\nvoid free_family(person *p)\n{\n    // Handle base case\n    if (p == NULL)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Free parents recursively\n    free_family(p-&gt;parents[0]);\n    free_family(p-&gt;parents[1]);\n\n    // Free child\n    free(p);\n}"

For black-and-white images, we thus need 1 bit per pixel, as 0 could represent black and 1 could represent white, as in the below.\n\n\n\na simple bitmap\n\n\nIn this sense, then, is an image just a bitmap (i.e., a map of bits). For more colorful images, you simply need more bits per pixel. A file format (like BMP, JPEG, or PNG) that supports “24-bit color” uses 24 bits per pixel. (BMP actually supports 1-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 24-, and 32-bit color.)\nA 24-bit BMP uses 8 bits to signify the amount of red in a pixel’s color, 8 bits to signify the amount of green in a pixel’s color, and 8 bits to signify the amount of blue in a pixel’s color. If you’ve ever heard of RGB color, well, there you have it: red, green, blue.\nIf the R, G, and B values of some pixel in a BMP are, say, 0xff, 0x00, and 0x00 in hexadecimal, that pixel is purely red, as 0xff (otherwise known as 255 in decimal) implies “a lot of red,” while 0x00 and 0x00 imply “no green” and “no blue,” respectively. In this problem, you’ll manipulate these R, G, and B values of individual pixels, ultimately creating your very own image filters.\nIn a file called helpers.c in a folder called filter-more, write a program to apply filters to BMPs."

    "text": "Background\n\nA Bit(map) More Technical\nRecall that a file is just a sequence of bits, arranged in some fashion. A 24-bit BMP file, then, is essentially just a sequence of bits, (almost) every 24 of which happen to represent some pixel’s color. But a BMP file also contains some “metadata,” information like an image’s height and width. That metadata is stored at the beginning of the file in the form of two data structures generally referred to as “headers,” not to be confused with C’s header files. (Incidentally, these headers have evolved over time. This problem uses the latest version of Microsoft’s BMP format, 4.0, which debuted with Windows 95.)\nThe first of these headers, called BITMAPFILEHEADER, is 14 bytes long. (Recall that 1 byte equals 8 bits.) The second of these headers, called BITMAPINFOHEADER, is 40 bytes long. Immediately following these headers is the actual bitmap: an array of bytes, triples of which represent a pixel’s color. However, BMP stores these triples backwards (i.e., as BGR), with 8 bits for blue, followed by 8 bits for green, followed by 8 bits for red. (Some BMPs also store the entire bitmap backwards, with an image’s top row at the end of the BMP file. But we’ve stored this problem set’s BMPs as described herein, with each bitmap’s top row first and bottom row last.) In other words, were we to convert the 1-bit smiley above to a 24-bit smiley, substituting red for black, a 24-bit BMP would store this bitmap as follows, where 0000ff signifies red and ffffff signifies white; we’ve highlighted in red all instances of 0000ff.\n\n\n\nred smile\n\n\nBecause we’ve presented these bits from left to right, top to bottom, in 8 columns, you can actually see the red smiley if you take a step back.\nTo be clear, recall that a hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits. Accordingly, ffffff in hexadecimal actually signifies 111111111111111111111111 in binary.\nNotice that you could represent a bitmap as a 2-dimensional array of pixels: where the image is an array of rows, each row is an array of pixels. Indeed, that’s how we’ve chosen to represent bitmap images in this problem.\n\n\nImage Filtering\nWhat does it even mean to filter an image? You can think of filtering an image as taking the pixels of some original image, and modifying each pixel in such a way that a particular effect is apparent in the resulting image.\n\nGrayscale\nOne common filter is the “grayscale” filter, where we take an image and want to convert it to black-and-white. How does that work?\nRecall that if the red, green, and blue values are all set to 0x00 (hexadecimal for 0), then the pixel is black. And if all values are set to 0xff (hexadecimal for 255), then the pixel is white. So long as the red, green, and blue values are all equal, the result will be varying shades of gray along the black-white spectrum, with higher values meaning lighter shades (closer to white) and lower values meaning darker shades (closer to black).\nSo to convert a pixel to grayscale, we just need to make sure the red, green, and blue values are all the same value. But how do we know what value to make them? Well, it’s probably reasonable to expect that if the original red, green, and blue values were all pretty high, then the new value should also be pretty high. And if the original values were all low, then the new value should also be low.\nIn fact, to ensure each pixel of the new image still has the same general brightness or darkness as the old image, we can take the average of the red, green, and blue values to determine what shade of grey to make the new pixel.\nIf you apply that to each pixel in the image, the result will be an image converted to grayscale.\n\n\nReflection\nSome filters might also move pixels around. Reflecting an image, for example, is a filter where the resulting image is what you would get by placing the original image in front of a mirror. So any pixels on the left side of the image should end up on the right, and vice versa.\nNote that all of the original pixels of the original image will still be present in the reflected image, it’s just that those pixels may have rearranged to be in a different place in the image.\n\n\nBlur\nThere are a number of ways to create the effect of blurring or softening an image. For this problem, we’ll use the “box blur,” which works by taking each pixel and, for each color value, giving it a new value by averaging the color values of neighboring pixels.\nConsider the following grid of pixels, where we’ve numbered each pixel.\n\n\n\na grid of pixels\n\n\nThe new value of each pixel would be the average of the values of all of the pixels that are within 1 row and column of the original pixel (forming a 3x3 box). For example, each of the color values for pixel 6 would be obtained by averaging the original color values of pixels 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11 (note that pixel 6 itself is included in the average). Likewise, the color values for pixel 11 would be be obtained by averaging the color values of pixels 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16.\nFor a pixel along the edge or corner, like pixel 15, we would still look for all pixels within 1 row and column: in this case, pixels 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16.\n\n\nEdges\nIn artificial intelligence algorithms for image processing, it is often useful to detect edges in an image: lines in the image that create a boundary between one object and another. One way to achieve this effect is by applying the Sobel operator to the image.\nLike image blurring, edge detection also works by taking each pixel, and modifying it based on the 3x3 grid of pixels that surrounds that pixel. But instead of just taking the average of the nine pixels, the Sobel operator computes the new value of each pixel by taking a weighted sum of the values for the surrounding pixels. And since edges between objects could take place in both a vertical and a horizontal direction, you’ll actually compute two weighted sums: one for detecting edges in the x direction, and one for detecting edges in the y direction. In particular, you’ll use the following two “kernels”:\n\n\n\nSobel kernels\n\n\nHow to interpret these kernels? In short, for each of the three color values for each pixel, we’ll compute two values Gx and Gy. To compute Gx for the red channel value of a pixel, for instance, we’ll take the original red values for the nine pixels that form a 3x3 box around the pixel, multiply them each by the corresponding value in the Gx kernel, and take the sum of the resulting values.\nWhy these particular values for the kernel? In the Gx direction, for instance, we’re multiplying the pixels to the right of the target pixel by a positive number, and multiplying the pixels to the left of the target pixel by a negative number. When we take the sum, if the pixels on the right are a similar color to the pixels on the left, the result will be close to 0 (the numbers cancel out). But if the pixels on the right are very different from the pixels on the left, then the resulting value will be very positive or very negative, indicating a change in color that likely is the result of a boundary between objects. And a similar argument holds true for calculating edges in the y direction.\nUsing these kernels, we can generate a Gx and Gy value for each of the red, green, and blue channels for a pixel. But each channel can only take on one value, not two: so we need some way to combine Gx and Gy into a single value. The Sobel filter algorithm combines Gx and Gy into a final value by calculating the square root of Gx^2 + Gy^2. And since channel values can only take on integer values from 0 to 255, be sure the resulting value is rounded to the nearest integer and capped at 255!\nAnd what about handling pixels at the edge, or in the corner of the image? There are many ways to handle pixels at the edge, but for the purposes of this problem, we’ll ask you to treat the image as if there was a 1 pixel solid black border around the edge of the image: therefore, trying to access a pixel past the edge of the image should be treated as a solid black pixel (values of 0 for each of red, green, and blue). This will effectively ignore those pixels from our calculations of Gx and Gy."

In addition, that file defines BYTE, DWORD, LONG, and WORD, data types normally found in the world of Windows programming. Notice how they’re just aliases for primitives with which you are (hopefully) already familiar. It appears that BITMAPFILEHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER make use of these types.\nPerhaps most importantly for you, this file also defines a struct called RGBTRIPLE that, quite simply, “encapsulates” three bytes: one blue, one green, and one red (the order, recall, in which we expect to find RGB triples actually on disk).\nWhy are these structs useful? Well, recall that a file is just a sequence of bytes (or, ultimately, bits) on disk. But those bytes are generally ordered in such a way that the first few represent something, the next few represent something else, and so on. “File formats” exist because the world has standardized what bytes mean what. Now, we could just read a file from disk into RAM as one big array of bytes. And we could just remember that the byte at array[i] represents one thing, while the byte at array[j] represents another. But why not give some of those bytes names so that we can retrieve them from memory more easily? That’s precisely what the structs in bmp.h allow us to do. Rather than think of some file as one long sequence of bytes, we can instead think of it as a sequence of structs.\n\n\nfilter.c\nNow, let’s open up filter.c. This file has been written already for you, but there are a couple important points worth noting here.\nFirst, notice the definition of filters on line 10. That string tells the program what the allowable command-line arguments to the program are: b, e, g, and r. Each of them specifies a different filter that we might apply to our images: blur, edge detection, grayscale, and reflection.\nThe next several lines open up an image file, make sure it’s indeed a BMP file, and read all of the pixel information into a 2D array called image.\nScroll down to the switch statement that begins on line 101. Notice that, depending on what filter we’ve chosen, a different function is called: if the user chooses filter b, the program calls the blur function; if e, then edges is called; if g, then grayscale is called; and if r, then reflect is called. Notice, too, that each of these functions take as arguments the height of the image, the width of the image, and the 2D array of pixels.\nThese are the functions you’ll (soon!) implement. As you might imagine, the goal is for each of these functions to edit the 2D array of pixels in such a way that the desired filter is applied to the image.\nThe remaining lines of the program take the resulting image and write them out to a new image file.\n\n\nhelpers.h\nNext, take a look at helpers.h. This file is quite short, and just provides the function prototypes for the functions you saw earlier.\nHere, take note of the fact that each function takes a 2D array called image as an argument, where image is an array of height many rows, and each row is itself another array of width many RGBTRIPLEs. So if image represents the whole picture, then image[0] represents the first row, and image[0][0] represents the pixel in the upper-left corner of the image.\n\n\nhelpers.c\nNow, open up helpers.c. Here’s where the implementation of the functions declared in helpers.h belong. But note that, right now, the implementations are missing! This part is up to you.\n\n\nMakefile\nFinally, let’s look at Makefile. This file specifies what should happen when we run a terminal command like make filter. Whereas programs you may have written before were confined to just one file, filter seems to use multiple files: filter.c and helpers.c. So we’ll need to tell make how to compile this file.\nTry compiling filter for yourself by going to your terminal and running\n$ make filter\n\nThen, you can run the program by running:\n$ ./filter -g images/yard.bmp out.bmp\n\nwhich takes the image at images/yard.bmp, and generates a new image called out.bmp after running the pixels through the grayscale function. grayscale doesn’t do anything just yet, though, so the output image should look the same as the original yard."

For black-and-white images, we thus need 1 bit per pixel, as 0 could represent black and 1 could represent white, as in the below.\n\n\n\na simple bitmap\n\n\nIn this sense, then, is an image just a bitmap (i.e., a map of bits). For more colorful images, you simply need more bits per pixel. A file format (like BMP, JPEG, or PNG) that supports “24-bit color” uses 24 bits per pixel. (BMP actually supports 1-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 24-, and 32-bit color.)\nA 24-bit BMP uses 8 bits to signify the amount of red in a pixel’s color, 8 bits to signify the amount of green in a pixel’s color, and 8 bits to signify the amount of blue in a pixel’s color. If you’ve ever heard of RGB color, well, there you have it: red, green, blue.\nIf the R, G, and B values of some pixel in a BMP are, say, 0xff, 0x00, and 0x00 in hexadecimal, that pixel is purely red, as 0xff (otherwise known as 255 in decimal) implies “a lot of red,” while 0x00 and 0x00 imply “no green” and “no blue,” respectively. In this problem, you’ll manipulate these R, G, and B values of individual pixels, ultimately creating your very own image filters.\nIn a file called helpers.c in a folder called filter-less, write a program to apply filters to BMPs.\nDistribution Code\nFor this problem, you’ll extend the functionality of code provided to you by CS50’s staff.\nDownload the distribution code\nLog into the homework codespace, click on your terminal window, and execute cd by itself.

How does something like that work?\n\nRecall that if the red, green, and blue values are all set to 0x00 (hexadecimal for 0), then the pixel is black. And if all values are set to 0xff (hexadecimal for 255), then the pixel is white. So long as the red, green, and blue values are all equal, the result will be varying shades of gray along the black-white spectrum, with higher values meaning lighter shades (closer to white) and lower values meaning darker shades (closer to black).\nSo to convert a pixel to grayscale, you just need to make sure the red, green, and blue values are all the same value. But how do you know what value to make them? Well, it’s probably reasonable to expect that if the original red, green, and blue values were all pretty high, then the new value should also be pretty high. And if the original values were all low, then the new value should also be low.\nIn fact, to ensure each pixel of the new image still has the same general brightness or darkness as the old image, you can take the average of the red, green, and blue values to determine what shade of grey to make the new pixel.\n\nIf you apply the above algorithm to each pixel in the image, the result will be an image converted to grayscale.\n\nThe function sepia should take an image and turn it into a sepia version of the same image.\n\nThe sepia algorithm\nMost image editing programs support a “sepia” filter, which gives images an old-timey feel by making the whole image look a bit reddish-brown.\n\nAn image can be converted to sepia by taking each pixel, and computing new red, green, and blue values based on the original values of the three.\nThere are a number of algorithms for converting an image to sepia, but for this problem, we’ll ask you to use the following algorithm. For each pixel, the sepia color values should be calculated based on the original color values per the below.\nsepiaRed = .393 * originalRed + .769 * originalGreen + .189 * originalBlue\nsepiaGreen = .349 * originalRed + .686 * originalGreen + .168 * originalBlue\nsepiaBlue = .272 * originalRed + .534 * originalGreen + .131 * originalBlue\nOf course, the result of each of these formulas may not be an integer, but each value could be rounded to the nearest integer. It’s also possible that the result of the formula is a number greater than 255, the maximum value for an 8-bit color value. In that case, the red, green, and blue values should be capped at 255. As a result, we can guarantee that the resulting red, green, and blue values will be whole numbers between 0 and 255, inclusive.\n\nIf you apply the above algorithm to each pixel in the image, the result will be an image converted to sepia.\n\nThe reflect function should take an image and reflect it horizontally.\n\nThe reflect algorithm\nSome more adventurous filters might go further than merely editing the pixels in place; they might move the pixels around the image. Reflecting an image, for example, is a filter where the resulting image is what you would get by placing the original image in front of a mirror.\n\nAny pixels on the left side of the image should end up on the right, and vice versa.\nNote that all of the original pixels of the original image will still be present in the reflected image, it’s just that those pixels may have been rearranged to be in a different place in the image.\n\nIf you apply the above algorithm to each pixel in the image, the result should look like a mirror image of the original.\n\nFinally, the blur function should take an image and turn it into a box-blurred version of the same image.\n\nThe blur algorithm\nThere are a number of ways to create the effect of blurring or softening an image, giving the resulting picture a hazy, dreamlike feeling (or perhaps just the feeling of having lost your glasses). For this problem, we’ll use the “box blur,” which works by taking each pixel and, for each color value, giving it a new value by averaging the color values of neighboring pixels.\n\nConsider the following grid of pixels, where we’ve numbered each pixel.\n\n\n\na grid of pixels\n\n\nThe new value of each pixel would be the average of the values of all of the pixels that are within 1 row and column of the original pixel (forming a 3x3 box). For example, each of the color values for pixel 6 would be obtained by averaging the original color values of pixels 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11 (note that pixel 6 itself is included in the average). Likewise, the color values for pixel 11 would be be obtained by averaging the color values of pixels 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16.\nFor a pixel along the edge or corner, like pixel 15, we would still look for all pixels within 1 row and column, but only those that are actually within the image: in this case, we’d take the average of pixels 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16.\n\nIf you apply the above algorithm to each pixel in the image, the result should look like a blurry, out-of-focus version of the original.\nYou should not modify any of the function signatures, nor should you modify any other files other than helpers.c."

    "text": "Hints\nImplement grayscale\nGiven the grayscale algorithm you learned about above, let’s write some pseudocode to help you tackle this problem:\nvoid grayscale(int height, int width, RGBTRIPLE image[height][width])\n{\n    // Loop over all pixels\n\n        // Take average of red, green, and blue\n\n        // Update pixel values\n}\nFirst, how might you loop over all pixels? Recall that the image’s pixels are stored in the two-dimensional array, image. To iterate over a two-dimensional array, you’ll need two loops, one nested inside the other.\nvoid grayscale(int height, int width, RGBTRIPLE image[height][width])\n{\n    // Loop over all pixels\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; height; i++)\n    {\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; width; j++)\n        {\n            // Take average of red, green, and blue\n\n            // Update pixel values\n        }\n    }\n}\nNow, you can use image[i][j] to access any individual pixel of the image. But how to take the average of the red, green, and blue elements? Recall each element of image is an RGBTRIPLE, which is the struct defined in bmp.h to represent a pixel. The usual syntax to access members of a struct applies, wherein image[i][j].rgbtRed will give you access to the RGBTRIPLE’s red value, image[i][j].rgbtGreen will give you access to its green value, and so on.\nWhen you compute the average, keep in mind the values of a pixel’s rgbtRed, rgbtGreen, and rgbtBlue components are all integers. So be sure to round any floating-point numbers to the nearest integer when assigning them to a pixel value! And why might you want to divide the sum of these integers by 3.0 and not 3?\nOnce you’ve averaged the pixel’s red, green, and blue values into a resulting grayscale color, go ahead and update the pixel’s red, green, and blue values. By now, you’re already acquainted with the syntax for assignment!\nImplement sepia\nLet’s write some pseudocode to help you implement the sepia algorithm we learned about above, recalling the use of nested for loops to visit every pixel.\nvoid sepia(int height, int width, RGBTRIPLE image[height][width])\n{\n    // Loop over all pixels\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; height; i++)\n    {\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; width; j++)\n        {\n            // Compute sepia values\n\n            // Update pixel with sepia values\n        }\n    }\n}\nTo compute the sepia values, revisit the above bullets. You have a formula to compute the sepia values, but there are still a few catches. In particular, you’ll need to…\n\nRound the result of each computation to the nearest integer\nEnsure the resulting value is no larger than 255\n\nHow might a function that returns the lesser of two integers come in handy while implementing sepia, particularly when you need to make sure a color’s value is no higher than 255? You’re welcome, but not required, to write a helper function of your own to do just that!\nImplement reflect\nUsing what you know about the algorithm for image reflection, you know that in the reflect function, you’ll need to swap the values of pixels on opposite sides of a row. Write some pseudocode to help you get started:\nvoid reflect(int height, int width, RGBTRIPLE image[height][width])\n{\n    // Loop over all pixels\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; height; i++)\n    {\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; width; j++)\n        {\n            // Swap pixels\n        }\n    }\n}\nRecall from lecture how we implemented swapping two values with a temporary variable. No need to use a separate function for swapping unless you would like to!\nAnd now’s a good time to think about your nested for loops. The outer for loop iterates over every row, while the inner for loop iterates over every pixel in that row. To successfully reflect a row, though, need you iterate over every pixel in it?\nImplement blur\nWhen implementing the blur algorithm, you might find that blurring one pixel ends up affecting the blur of another pixel. Therefore, it might be best to create a copy of image by declaring a new, two-dimensional array with code like RGBTRIPLE copy[height][width];. Then copy image into copy, pixel by pixel, with nested for loops, like so:\nvoid blur(int height, int width, RGBTRIPLE image[height][width])\n{\n    // Create a copy of image\n    RGBTRIPLE copy[height][width];\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; height; i++)\n    {\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; width; j++)\n        {\n            copy[i][j] = image[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n}\nNow, you can read pixels’ colors from copy but write (i.e., change) pixels’ colors in image!"

    "text": "You already know about plurality elections, which follow a very simple algorithm for determining the winner of an election: every voter gets one vote, and the candidate with the most votes wins.\nBut the plurality vote does have some disadvantages. What happens, for instance, in an election with three candidates, and the ballots below are cast?\n\n\n\nFive ballots, tie betweeen Alice and Bob\n\n\nA plurality vote would here declare a tie between Alice and Bob, since each has two votes. But is that the right outcome?\nThere’s another kind of voting system known as a ranked-choice voting system. In a ranked-choice system, voters can vote for more than one candidate. Instead of just voting for their top choice, they can rank the candidates in order of preference. The resulting ballots might therefore look like the below.\n\n\n\nFive ballots, with ranked preferences\n\n\nHere, each voter, in addition to specifying their first preference candidate, has also indicated their second and third choices. And now, what was previously a tied election could now have a winner. The race was originally tied between Alice and Bob, so Charlie was out of the running. But the voter who chose Charlie preferred Alice over Bob, so Alice could here be declared the winner.\nRanked choice voting can also solve yet another potential drawback of plurality voting. Take a look at the following ballots.\n\n\n\nNine ballots, with ranked preferences\n\n\nWho should win this election? In a plurality vote where each voter chooses their first preference only, Charlie wins this election with four votes compared to only three for Bob and two for Alice. But a majority of the voters (5 out of the 9) would be happier with either Alice or Bob instead of Charlie. By considering ranked preferences, a voting system may be able to choose a winner that better reflects the preferences of the voters.\nOne such ranked choice voting system is the instant runoff system. In an instant runoff election, voters can rank as many candidates as they wish. If any candidate has a majority (more than 50%) of the first preference votes, that candidate is declared the winner of the election.\nIf no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, then an “instant runoff” occurrs. The candidate who received the fewest number of votes is eliminated from the election, and anyone who originally chose that candidate as their first preference now has their second preference considered. Why do it this way? Effectively, this simulates what would have happened if the least popular candidate had not been in the election to begin with.\nThe process repeats: if no candidate has a majority of the votes, the last place candidate is eliminated, and anyone who voted for them will instead vote for their next preference (who hasn’t themselves already been eliminated). Once a candidate has a majority, that candidate is declared the winner.\nSounds a bit more complicated than a plurality vote, doesn’t it? But it arguably has the benefit of being an election system where the winner of the election more accurately represents the preferences of the voters.

Two constants are defined: MAX_CANDIDATES for the maximum number of candidates in the election, and MAX_VOTERS for the maximum number of voters in the election.\n// Max voters and candidates\n#define MAX_VOTERS 100\n#define MAX_CANDIDATES 9\nNotice that MAX_CANDIDATES is used to size an array, candidates.\n// Array of candidates\ncandidate candidates[MAX_CANDIDATES];\ncandidates is an array of candidates. In runoff.c a candidate is a struct. Every candidate has a string field for their name, an int representing the number of votes they currently have, and a bool value called eliminated that indicates whether the candidate has been eliminated from the election. The array candidates will keep track of all of the candidates in the election.\n// Candidates have name, vote count, eliminated status\ntypedef struct\n{\n    string name;\n    int votes;\n    bool eliminated;\n}\ncandidate;\nNow you can better understand preferences, the two-dimensional array. The array preferences[i] will represent all of the preferences for voter number i. The integer, preferences[i][j], will store the index of the candidate, from the candidates array, who is the jth preference for voter i.\n// preferences[i][j] is jth preference for voter i\nint preferences[MAX_VOTERS][MAX_CANDIDATES];\nThe program also has two global variables: voter_count and candidate_count.\n// Numbers of voters and candidates\nint voter_count;\nint candidate_count;\nNow onto main. Notice that after determining the number of candidates and the number of voters, the main voting loop begins, giving every voter a chance to vote. As the voter enters their preferences, the vote function is called to keep track of all of the preferences. If at any point, the ballot is deemed to be invalid, the program exits.\nOnce all of the votes are in, another loop begins: this one’s going to keep looping through the runoff process of checking for a winner and eliminating the last place candidate until there is a winner.\nThe first call here is to a function called tabulate, which should look at all of the voters’ preferences and compute the current vote totals, by looking at each voter’s top choice candidate who hasn’t yet been eliminated. Next, the print_winner function should print out the winner if there is one; if there is, the program is over. But otherwise, the program needs to determine the fewest number of votes anyone still in the election received (via a call to find_min). If it turns out that everyone in the election is tied with the same number of votes (as determined by the is_tie function), the election is declared a tie; otherwise, the last-place candidate (or candidates) is eliminated from the election via a call to the eliminate function.\nIf you look a bit further down in the file, you’ll see that the rest of the functions—vote, tabulate, print_winner, find_min, is_tie, and eliminate—are all left to up to you to complete! You should only modify these functions in runoff.c, though you may #include additional header files atop runoff.c if you’d like"

    "text": "Problem to Solve\nIn a substitution cipher, we “encrypt” (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) a message by replacing every letter with another letter. To do so, we use a key: in this case, a mapping of each of the letters of the alphabet to the letter it should correspond to when we encrypt it. To “decrypt” the message, the receiver of the message would need to know the key, so that they can reverse the process: translating the encrypt text (generally called ciphertext) back into the original message (generally called plaintext).\nA key, for example, might be the string NQXPOMAFTRHLZGECYJIUWSKDVB. This 26-character key means that A (the first letter of the alphabet) should be converted into N (the first character of the key), B (the second letter of the alphabet) should be converted into Q (the second character of the key), and so forth.\nA message like HELLO, then, would be encrypted as FOLLE, replacing each of the letters according to the mapping determined by the key.\nIn a file called substitution.c in a folder called substitution, create a program that enables you to encrypt messages using a substitution cipher. At the time the user executes the program, they should decide, by providing a command-line argument, on what the key should be in the secret message they’ll provide at runtime."

    "section": "What to do",
    "text": "What to do\nAccording to Scholastic, E.B. White’s Charlotte’s Web is between a second- and fourth-grade reading level, and Lois Lowry’s The Giver is between an eighth- and twelfth-grade reading level. What does it mean, though, for a book to be at a particular reading level?\nWell, in many cases, a human expert might read a book and make a decision on the grade (i.e., year in school) for which they think the book is most appropriate. But an algorithm could likely figure that out too!\nIn a file called readability.c in a folder called readability, you’ll implement a program that calculates the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text. Your program should print as output “Grade X” where “X” is the grade level computed, rounded to the nearest integer. If the grade level is 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate reading level), your program should output “Grade 16+” instead of giving the exact index number. If the grade level is less than 1, your program should output “Before Grade 1”.\nBackground\nSo what sorts of traits are characteristic of higher reading levels? Well, longer words probably correlate with higher reading levels. Likewise, longer sentences probably correlate with higher reading levels, too.\nA number of “readability tests” have been developed over the years that define formulas for computing the reading level of a text. One such readability test is the Coleman-Liau index. The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output that (U.S.) grade level that is needed to understand some text. The formula is\nindex = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8\n\nwhere L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.\nSpecification\nFor the purpose of this problem, we’ll consider any sequence of characters separated by a space to be a word (so a hyphenated word like “sister-in-law” should be considered one word, not three). You may assume that a sentence:\n\nwill contain at least one word;\nwill not start or end with a space; and\nwill not have multiple spaces in a row.\n\nUnder those assumptions, you might already be able to find a mathematical relationship between the number of words and the number of spaces.\nYou are, of course, welcome to attempt a more sophisticated solution that can tolerate multiple spaces between words! We’ve tuned check50 to accept either approach to spaces, so the choice is yours."

For instance, this problem is really only a handful of problems:\n\nPrompt the user for some text\nCount the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text\nCompute the Coleman-Liau index\nPrint the grade level\n\nLet’s write some pseudcode as comments to remind you to do just that:\n#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;math.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for some text\n\n    // Count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text\n\n    // Compute the Coleman-Liau index\n\n    // Print the grade level\n}\n\nConvert the pseudocode to code\nFirst, consider how you might prompt the user for some text. Recall that get_string, a function in the CS50 library, can prompt the user for a string.\n#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;math.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for some text\n    string text = get_string(\"Text: \");\n\n    // Count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text\n\n    // Compute the Coleman-Liau index\n\n    // Print the grade level\n}\n\nNow that you’ve collected input from the user, you can begin to analyze that input. First, try to count the number of letters in the text. Consider letters to be uppercase or lowercase alphabetical character, not punctuation, digits, or other symbols.\nOne way to approach this problem is to create a function called count_letters that takes a string, text, as input, and then returns the number of letters in that text as an int.\nint count_letters(string text)\n{\n    // Return the number of letters in text\n}\n\nYou’ll need to write your own code to count the number of letters in the text. But someone more experienced than you may have already written a function to determine if a character is alphabetical. This is a good opportunity to use the CS50 manual, a collection of explanations of common functions in the C Standard Library.\nYou can integrate count_letters into the code you’ve already written, as follows.\n#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;math.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint count_letters(string text);\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for some text\n    string text = get_string(\"Text: \");\n\n    // Count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text\n    int letters = count_letters(text);\n\n    // Compute the Coleman-Liau index\n\n    // Print the grade level\n}\n\nint count_letters(string text)\n{\n    // Return the number of letters in text\n}\n\nNext, write a function to count words.\nint count_words(string text)\n{\n    // Return the number of words in text\n}\n\nYou can now integrate count_words into your program as follows:\n#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;math.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint count_letters(string text);\nint count_words(string text);\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for some text\n    string text = get_string(\"Text: \");\n\n    // Count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text\n    int letters = count_letters(text);\n    int words = count_words(text);\n\n    // Compute the Coleman-Liau index\n\n    // Print the grade level\n}\n\nint count_letters(string text)\n{\n    // Return the number of letters in text\n}\n\nint count_words(string text)\n{\n    // Return the number of words in text\n}\n\nFinally, write a function to count sentences. You can consider any sequence of characters that ends with a . or a ! or a ? to be a sentence.\nint count_sentences(string text)\n{\n    // Return the number of sentences in text\n}\n\nYou can integrate count_sentences into your program as follows:\n#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;math.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint count_letters(string text);\nint count_words(string text);\nint count_sentences(string text);\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for some text\n    string text = get_string(\"Text: \");\n\n    // Count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text\n    int letters = count_letters(text);\n    int words = count_words(text);\n    int sentences = count_sentences(text);\n\n    // Compute the Coleman-Liau index\n\n    // Print the grade level\n}\n\nint count_letters(string text)\n{\n    // Return the number of letters in text\n}\n\nint count_words(string text)\n{\n    // Return the number of words in text\n}\n\nint count_sentences(string text)\n{\n    // Return the number of sentences in text\n}\n\nFinally, compute the Coleman-Liau index and print the resulting grade level.\n\nRecall that the Coleman-Liau index is computed using index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8\nL is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text: that is, the number of letters divided by the number of words, all multiplied by 100.\nS is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text: that is, the number of sentences divided by the number of words, all multiplied by 100.\nYou’ll want to round the result to the nearest whole number, so recall that round is declared in math.h, per manual.cs50.io.\nRecall that, when dividing values of type int in C, the result will also be an int, with any remainder (i.e., digits after the decimal point) discarded. Put another way, the result will be “truncated.” You might want to cast your one or more values to float before performing division when calculating L and S!\n\nIf the resulting index number is 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate reading level), your program should output “Grade 16+” instead of outputting an exact index number. If the index number is less than 1, your program should output “Before Grade 1”.\nHow to Test\nTry running your program on the following texts, to ensure you see the specified grade level. Be sure to copy only the text, no extra spaces.\n\nOne fish. Two fish. Red fish. Blue fish. (Before Grade 1)\nWould you like them here or there? I would not like them here or there. I would not like them anywhere. (Grade 2)\nCongratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away! (Grade 3)\nHarry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework, but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of the night. And he also happened to be a wizard. (Grade 5)\nIn my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. (Grade 7)\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice \"without pictures or conversation?\" (Grade 8)\nWhen he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. (Grade 8)\nThere are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. (Grade 9)\nIt was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him. (Grade 10)\nA large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs, digraphs, integers, arrays of integers, finite families of finite sets, boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains.

    "text": "Problem to Solve\nA credit (or debit) card, of course, is a plastic card with which you can pay for goods and services. Printed on that card is a number that’s stored in a database somewhere, so that when your card is used to buy something, the creditor knows whom to bill. There are a lot of people with credit cards in this world, so those numbers are pretty long: For example, MasterCard uses 16-digit numbers, Visa uses 13- and 16-digit numbers, etc. Those are decimal numbers (0 through 9), not binary, which means, for instance, that American Express could print as many as 10^15 = 1,000,000,000,000,000 unique cards! (That’s, um, a quadrillion.)\nActually, that’s a bit of an exaggeration, because credit card numbers actually have some structure to them. American Express numbers start with 34 or 37; most MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55 (they also have some other potential starting numbers which we won’t concern ourselves with for this problem); and all Visa numbers start with 4. But credit card numbers also have a “checksum” built into them, a mathematical relationship between at least one number and others. That checksum enables computers (or humans who like math) to detect typos (e.g., transpositions), if not fraudulent numbers, without having to query a database, which can be slow. Of course, a dishonest mathematician could certainly craft a fake number that nonetheless respects the mathematical constraint, so a database lookup is still necessary for more rigorous checks.\nIn a file called credit.c in a folder called credit, implement a program in C that checks the validity of a given credit card number."

    "text": "Luhn’s Algorithm\nSo what’s the secret formula? Well, most cards use an algorithm invented by Hans Peter Luhn of IBM. According to Luhn’s algorithm, you can determine if a credit card number is (syntactically) valid as follows:\n\nMultiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit, and then add those products’ digits together.\nAdd the sum to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2.\nIf the total’s last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid!\n\nThat’s kind of confusing, so let’s try an example with a Visa: 4003600000000014.\n\nFor the sake of discussion, let’s first underline every other digit, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit:\n\n\n4\n\n003600000000014\nOkay, let’s multiply each of the underlined digits by 2, starting with the 2nd to last:\n1•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 6•2 + 0•2 + 4•2\nThat gives us:\n2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 12 + 0 + 8\nNow let’s add those products’ digits (i.e., not the products themselves) together:\n2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 13\n\nNow let’s add that sum (13) to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2 (starting from the end):\n\n13 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 20\n\nYup, the last digit in that sum (20) is a 0, so this card is legit!\n\nSo, validating credit card numbers isn’t hard, but it does get a bit tedious by hand. Let’s write a program."

So that we can automate some tests of your code, we ask that your program’s last line of output be AMEX\\n or MASTERCARD\\n or VISA\\n or INVALID\\n, nothing more, nothing less. For simplicity, you may assume that the user’s input will be entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed on an actual card) and that it won’t have leading zeroes. But do not assume that the user’s input will fit in an int! Best to use get_long from CS50’s library to get users’ input. (Why?)\nConsider the below representative of how your own program should behave when passed a valid credit card number (sans hyphens).\n$ ./credit\nNumber: 4003600000000014\nVISA\n\nNow, get_long itself will reject hyphens (and more) anyway:\n$ ./credit\nNumber: 4003-6000-0000-0014\nNumber: foo\nNumber: 4003600000000014\nVISA\n\nBut it’s up to you to catch inputs that are not credit card numbers (e.g., a phone number), even if numeric:\n$ ./credit\nNumber: 6176292929\nINVALID\n\nTest out your program with a whole bunch of inputs, both valid and invalid. (We certainly will!) Here are a few card numbers that PayPal recommends for testing.\nIf your program behaves incorrectly on some inputs (or doesn’t compile at all), time to debug!\n\nWalkthrough\n\n\nHow to Test Your Code\nYou can also execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your code using check50.

    "text": "Advice\n\nRecall that you can get an int from a user with get_int, which is declared in cs50.h.\nRecall that you can print a string with printf, which is declared in stdio.h.\n\n\nWrite some code that you know will compile\nEven though this program won’t do anything, it should at least compile with make!\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n\n}\n\n\nWrite some pseudocode before writing more code\nIf unsure how to solve the problem itself, break it down into smaller problems that you can probably solve first. For instance, this problem is really two problems:\n\nPrompt the user for the pyramid’s height\nPrint a pyramid of that height\n\nSo write some pseudcode as comments that remind you to do just that:\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for the pyramid's height\n\n    // Print a pyramid of that height\n}\n\n\nConvert the pseudocode to code\nFirst, consider how you might prompt the user for the pyramid’s height. Recall that a do while loop is helpful when you want to do something at least once, and possibly again and again, as in the below:\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for the pyramid's height\n    int n;\n    do\n    {\n        n = get_int(\"Height: \");\n    }\n    while (n &lt; 1);\n\n    // Print a pyramid of that height\n}\nSecond, consider how you might print a pyramid of that height, from top to bottom. Notice how the first row should have one brick, the second row should have two bricks, and so on. Odds are you’ll want a loop, as in the below, even if not (yet!) sure what to put in that loop. So add some more pseudocode as a comment for now:\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for the pyramid's height\n    int n;\n    do\n    {\n        n = get_int(\"Height: \");\n    }\n    while (n &lt; 1);\n\n    // Print a pyramid of that height\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)\n    {\n        // Print row of bricks\n    }\n}\nHow to print that row of bricks? Well, wouldn’t it be nice if there were a function called print_row that could do just that? Let’s suppose that there is:\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nvoid print_row(int bricks);\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for the pyramid's height\n    int n;\n    do\n    {\n        n = get_int(\"Height: \");\n    }\n    while (n &lt; 1);\n\n    // Print a pyramid of that height\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)\n    {\n        // Print row of bricks\n    }\n}\n\nvoid print_row(int bricks)\n{\n    // Print row of bricks\n}\nWe could then call that function from main, as in the below:\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nvoid print_row(int bricks);\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for the pyramid's height\n    int n;\n    do\n    {\n        n = get_int(\"Height: \");\n    }\n    while (n &lt; 1);\n\n    // Print a pyramid of that height\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)\n    {\n        // Print row of bricks\n        print_row(i + 1);\n    }\n}\n\nvoid print_row(int bricks)\n{\n    // Print row of bricks\n}\nWhy i + 1, though?\nLet’s now implement print_row:\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nvoid print_row(int bricks);\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for the pyramid's height\n    int n;\n    do\n    {\n        n = get_int(\"Height: \");\n    }\n    while (n &lt; 1);\n\n    // Print a pyramid of that height\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)\n    {\n        // Print row of bricks\n        print_row(i + 1);\n    }\n}\n\nvoid print_row(int bricks)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; bricks; i++)\n    {\n        printf(\"#\");\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n}\nWhy the \\n at the end, though?\nUnfortunately, this code prints a left-aligned pyramid, but you need a right-aligned one! Perhaps we should print some blank spaces before some of the bricks, to move them to the right? Let’s change print_row as follows so that it can print both:\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nvoid print_row(int spaces, int bricks);\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for the pyramid's height\n    int n;\n    do\n    {\n        n = get_int(\"Height: \");\n    }\n    while (n &lt; 1);\n\n    // Print a pyramid of that height\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)\n    {\n        // Print row of bricks\n    }\n}\n\nvoid print_row(int spaces, int bricks)\n{\n    // Print spaces\n\n    // Print bricks\n}\nSome pseudocode now remains in both main and print_row, so that we leave to you!\nAnd consider whether you could factor out some of the code in main to a get_height function, too, that returns the int you need!\nNote this walkthrough specifies your program should prompt the user for a pyramid’s height and re-prompt if the user inputs a value less than 1 or greater than 8. The specification only requires you to re-prompt the user if they input a value less than 1.\nTests\nDoes your code work as prescribed when you input:\n\n-1 or other negative numbers?\n0?\n1 or other positive numbers?\nletters or words?\nno input at all, when you only hit Enter?"

Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks’ prices and portfolios’ values, it will also let you buy (okay, “buy”) and sell (okay, “sell”) stocks by querying for stocks’ prices.\nIndeed, there are tools (one is known as IEX) that let you download stock quotes via their API (application programming interface) using URLs like https://api.iex.cloud/v1/data/core/quote/nflx?token=API_KEY. Notice how Netflix’s symbol (NFLX) is embedded in this URL; that’s how IEX knows whose data to return. That link won’t actually return any data because IEX requires you to use an API key, but if it did, you’d see a response in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format like this:\n{\n  \"avgTotalVolume\":6787785,\n  \"calculationPrice\":\"tops\",\n  \"change\":1.46,\n  \"changePercent\":0.00336,\n  \"close\":null,\n  \"closeSource\":\"official\",\n  \"closeTime\":null,\n  \"companyName\":\"Netflix Inc.\",\n  \"currency\":\"USD\",\n  \"delayedPrice\":null,\n  \"delayedPriceTime\":null,\n  \"extendedChange\":null,\n  \"extendedChangePercent\":null,\n  \"extendedPrice\":null,\n  \"extendedPriceTime\":null,\n  \"high\":null,\n  \"highSource\":\"IEX real time price\",\n  \"highTime\":1699626600947,\n  \"iexAskPrice\":460.87,\n  \"iexAskSize\":123,\n  \"iexBidPrice\":435,\n  \"iexBidSize\":100,\n  \"iexClose\":436.61,\n  \"iexCloseTime\":1699626704609,\n  \"iexLastUpdated\":1699626704609,\n  \"iexMarketPercent\":0.00864679844447232,\n  \"iexOpen\":437.37,\n  \"iexOpenTime\":1699626600859,\n  \"iexRealtimePrice\":436.61,\n  \"iexRealtimeSize\":5,\n  \"iexVolume\":965,\n  \"lastTradeTime\":1699626704609,\n  \"latestPrice\":436.61,\n  \"latestSource\":\"IEX real time price\",\n  \"latestTime\":\"9:31:44 AM\",\n  \"latestUpdate\":1699626704609,\n  \"latestVolume\":null,\n  \"low\":null,\n  \"lowSource\":\"IEX real time price\",\n  \"lowTime\":1699626634509,\n  \"marketCap\":192892118443,\n  \"oddLotDelayedPrice\":null,\n  \"oddLotDelayedPriceTime\":null,\n  \"open\":null,\n  \"openTime\":null,\n  \"openSource\":\"official\",\n  \"peRatio\":43.57,\n  \"previousClose\":435.15,\n  \"previousVolume\":2735507,\n  \"primaryExchange\":\"NASDAQ\",\n  \"symbol\":\"NFLX\",\n  \"volume\":null,\n  \"week52High\":485,\n  \"week52Low\":271.56,\n  \"ytdChange\":0.4790450244167119,\n  \"isUSMarketOpen\":true\n}\nNotice how, between the curly braces, there’s a comma-separated list of key-value pairs, with a colon separating each key from its value. We’re going to be doing something very similar with our own stock database API.\nGetting Started\nDownload the distribution code\nStart by clicking inside your terminal window, then execute cd by itself. You should find that its “prompt” resembles the below.\n$\nNext execute\nwget https://github.com/SQ4007-2025/website/raw/refs/heads/master/homework/data/finance.zip\nin order to download a ZIP called finance.zip into your codespace.\nThen execute\nunzip finance.zip\nto create a folder called finance. You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute\nrm finance.zip\nand respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP file you downloaded.\nNow type\ncd finance\nfollowed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.\nfinance/ $\nExecute ls by itself, and you should see a few files and folders:\napp.py  finance.db  helpers.py  requirements.txt  static/  templates/\nIf you run into any trouble, follow these same steps again and see if you can determine where you went wrong!\nRunning\nStart Flask’s built-in web server (within finance/):\n$ flask run\nVisit the URL outputted by flask to see the distribution code in action. You won’t be able to log in or register, though, just yet!\nWithin finance/, run sqlite3 finance.db to open finance.db with sqlite3. If you run .schema in the SQLite prompt, notice how finance.db comes with a table called users. Take a look at its structure (i.e., schema). Notice how, by default, new users will receive $10,000 in cash. But if you run SELECT * FROM users;, there aren’t (yet!) any users (i.e., rows) therein to browse.\nAnother way to view finance.db is with a program called phpLiteAdmin. Click on finance.db in your codespace’s file browser, then click the link shown underneath the text “Please visit the following link to authorize GitHub Preview”. You should see information about the database itself, as well as a table, users, just like you saw in the sqlite3 prompt with .schema.\nUnderstanding\napp.py\nOpen up app.py. Atop the file are a bunch of imports, among them a SQL module and a few helper functions. More on those soon.\nAfter configuring Flask, notice how this file disables caching of responses (provided you’re in debugging mode, which you are by default in your code50 codespace), lest you make a change to some file but your browser not notice. Notice next how it configures Jinja with a custom “filter,” usd, a function (defined in helpers.py) that will make it easier to format values as US dollars (USD). It then further configures Flask to store sessions on the local filesystem (i.e., disk) as opposed to storing them inside of (digitally signed) cookies, which is Flask’s default. The file then configures CS50’s SQL module to use finance.db.\nThereafter are a whole bunch of routes, only two of which are fully implemented: login and logout. Read through the implementation of login first. Notice how it uses db.execute (from CS50’s library) to query finance.db. And notice how it uses check_password_hash to compare hashes of users’ passwords. Also notice how login “remembers” that a user is logged in by storing his or her user_id, an INTEGER, in session. That way, any of this file’s routes can check which user, if any, is logged in. Finally, notice how once the user has successfully logged in, login will redirect to \"/\", taking the user to their home page. Meanwhile, notice how logout simply clears session, effectively logging a user out.\nNotice how most routes are “decorated” with @login_required (a function defined in helpers.py too). That decorator ensures that, if a user tries to visit any of those routes, he or she will first be redirected to login so as to log in.\nNotice too how most routes support GET and POST. Even so, most of them (for now!) simply return an “apology,” since they’re not yet implemented.\nhelpers.py\nNext take a look at helpers.py. Ah, there’s the implementation of apology. Notice how it ultimately renders a template, apology.html. It also happens to define within itself another function, escape, that it simply uses to replace special characters in apologies. By defining escape inside of apology, we’ve scoped the former to the latter alone; no other functions will be able (or need) to call it.\nNext in the file is login_required. No worries if this one’s a bit cryptic, but if you’ve ever wondered how a function can return another function, here’s an example!\nThereafter is lookup, a function that, given a symbol (e.g., NFLX), returns a stock quote for a company in the form of a dict with three keys: name, whose value is a str; price, whose value is a float; and symbol, whose value is a str, a canonicalized (uppercase) version of a stock’s symbol, irrespective of how that symbol was capitalized when passed into lookup. Note that these are not “real-time” prices but do change over time, just like in the real world!\nLast in the file is usd, a short function that simply formats a float as USD (e.g., 1234.56 is formatted as $1,234.56).\nrequirements.txt\nNext take a quick look at requirements.txt. That file simply prescribes the packages on which this app will depend.\nstatic/\nGlance too at static/, inside of which is styles.css. That’s where some initial CSS lives. You’re welcome to alter it as you see fit.\ntemplates/\nNow look in templates/. In login.html is, essentially, just an HTML form, stylized with Bootstrap. In apology.html, meanwhile, is a template for an apology. Recall that apology in helpers.py took two arguments: message, which was passed to render_template as the value of bottom, and, optionally, code, which was passed to render_template as the value of top. Notice in apology.html how those values are ultimately used! And here’s why 0:-)\nLast up is layout.html. It’s a bit bigger than usual, but that’s mostly because it comes with a fancy, mobile-friendly “navbar” (navigation bar), also based on Bootstrap. Notice how it defines a block, main, inside of which templates (including apology.html and login.html) shall go. It also includes support for Flask’s message flashing so that you can relay messages from one route to another for the user to see.\nSpecification\nregister\nComplete the implementation of register in such a way that it allows a user to register for an account via a form.\n\nRequire that a user input a username, implemented as a text field whose name is username. Render an apology if the user’s input is blank or the username already exists.\n\nNote that cs50.SQL.execute will raise a ValueError exception if you try to INSERT a duplicate username because we have created a UNIQUE INDEX on users.username. Be sure, then, to use try and except to determine if the username already exists.\n\nRequire that a user input a password, implemented as a text field whose name is password, and then that same password again, implemented as a text field whose name is confirmation. Render an apology if either input is blank or the passwords do not match.\nSubmit the user’s input via POST to /register.\nINSERT the new user into users, storing a hash of the user’s password, not the password itself. Hash the user’s password with generate_password_hash Odds are you’ll want to create a new template (e.g., register.html) that’s quite similar to login.html.\n\nOnce you’ve implemented register correctly, you should be able to register for an account and log in (since login and logout already work)! And you should be able to see your rows via phpLiteAdmin or sqlite3.\nquote\nComplete the implementation of quote in such a way that it allows a user to look up a stock’s current price.\n\nRequire that a user input a stock’s symbol, implemented as a text field whose name is symbol.\nSubmit the user’s input via POST to /quote.\nOdds are you’ll want to create two new templates (e.g., quote.html and quoted.html). When a user visits /quote via GET, render one of those templates, inside of which should be an HTML form that submits to /quote via POST. In response to a POST, quote can render that second template, embedding within it one or more values from lookup.\n\nbuy\nComplete the implementation of buy in such a way that it enables a user to buy stocks.\n\nRequire that a user input a stock’s symbol, implemented as a text field whose name is symbol. Render an apology if the input is blank or the symbol does not exist (as per the return value of lookup).\nRequire that a user input a number of shares, implemented as a text field whose name is shares. Render an apology if the input is not a positive integer.\nSubmit the user’s input via POST to /buy.\nUpon completion, redirect the user to the home page.\nOdds are you’ll want to call lookup to look up a stock’s current price.\nOdds are you’ll want to SELECT how much cash the user currently has in users.\nAdd one or more new tables to finance.db via which to keep track of the purchase. Store enough information so that you know who bought what at what price and when.\n\nUse appropriate SQLite types.\nDefine UNIQUE indexes on any fields that should be unique.\nDefine (non-UNIQUE) indexes on any fields via which you will search (as via SELECT with WHERE).\n\nRender an apology, without completing a purchase, if the user cannot afford the number of shares at the current price.\nYou don’t need to worry about race conditions (or use transactions).\n\nOnce you’ve implemented buy correctly, you should be able to see users’ purchases in your new table(s) via phpLiteAdmin or sqlite3.\nindex\nComplete the implementation of index in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing, for the user currently logged in, which stocks the user owns, the numbers of shares owned, the current price of each stock, and the total value of each holding (i.e., shares times price). Also display the user’s current cash balance along with a grand total (i.e., stocks’ total value plus cash).\n\nOdds are you’ll want to execute multiple SELECTs. Depending on how you implement your table(s), you might find GROUP BY, HAVING, SUM, and/or WHERE of interest.\nOdds are you’ll want to call lookup for each stock.\n\nsell\nComplete the implementation of sell in such a way that it enables a user to sell shares of a stock (that he or she owns).\n\nRequire that a user input a stock’s symbol, implemented as a select menu whose name is symbol. Render an apology if the user fails to select a stock or if (somehow, once submitted) the user does not own any shares of that stock.\nRequire that a user input a number of shares, implemented as a text field whose name is shares. Render an apology if the input is not a positive integer or if the user does not own that many shares of the stock.\nSubmit the user’s input via POST to /sell.\nUpon completion, redirect the user to the home page.\nYou don’t need to worry about race conditions (or use transactions).\n\nhistory\nComplete the implementation of history in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing all of a user’s transactions ever, listing row by row each and every buy and every sell.\n\nFor each row, make clear whether a stock was bought or sold and include the stock’s symbol, the (purchase or sale) price, the number of shares bought or sold, and the date and time at which the transaction occurred.\nYou might need to alter the table you created for buy or supplement it with an additional table. Try to minimize redundancies.\n\nPersonal touch\nImplement at least one personal touch of your choice:\n\nAllow users to change their passwords.\nAllow users to add additional cash to their account.\nAllow users to buy more shares or sell shares of stocks they already own via index itself, without having to type stocks’ symbols manually.\nImplement some other feature of comparable scope.\n\nTesting\nBe sure to test your web app, as by\n\nregistering a new user and verifying that their portfolio page loads with the correct information,\nrequesting a quote using a valid stock symbol,\npurchasing one stock multiple times, verifying that the portfolio displays correct totals,\nselling all or some of a stock, again verifying the portfolio, and\nverifying that your history page shows all transactions for your logged in user.\n\nAlso test some unexpected usage, as by\n\ninputting alphabetical strings into forms when only numbers are expected,\ninputting zero or negative numbers into forms when only positive numbers are expected,\ninputting floating-point values into forms when only integers are expected,\ntrying to spend more cash than a user has,\ntrying to sell more shares than a user has,\ninputting an invalid stock symbol, and\nincluding potentially dangerous characters like ' and ; in SQL queries."

Your prompt should now resemble the below.\nbirthdays/ $\nIf all was successful, you should execute\nls\nand you should see the following files and folders:\napp.py  birthdays.db  static/  templates/\nIf you run into any trouble, follow these same steps again and see if you can determine where you went wrong!\nUnderstanding\nIn app.py, you’ll find the start of a Flask web application. The application has one route (/) that accepts both POST requests (after the if) and GET requests (after the else). Currently, when the / route is requested via GET, the index.html template is rendered. When the / route is requested via POST, the user is redirected back to / via GET.\nbirthdays.db is a SQLite database with one table, birthdays, that has four columns: id, name, month, and day. There are a few rows already in this table, though ultimately your web application will support the ability to insert rows into this table!\nIn the static directory is a styles.css file containing the CSS code for this web application. No need to edit this file, though you’re welcome to if you’d like!\nIn the templates directory is an index.html file that will be rendered when the user views your web application.\nImplementation\nComplete the implementation of a web application to let users store and keep track of birthdays.\n\nWhen the / route is requested via GET, your web application should display, in a table, all of the people in your database along with their birthdays.\n\nFirst, in app.py, add logic in your GET request handling to query the birthdays.db database for all birthdays. Pass all of that data to your index.html template.\nThen, in index.html, add logic to render each birthday as a row in the table. Each row should have two columns: one column for the person’s name and another column for the person’s birthday.\n\nWhen the / route is requested via POST, your web application should add a new birthday to your database and then re-render the index page.\n\nFirst, in index.html, add an HTML form. The form should let users type in a name, a birthday month, and a birthday day. Be sure the form submits to / (its “action”) with a method of post.\nThen, in app.py, add logic in your POST request handling to INSERT a new row into the birthdays table based on the data supplied by the user.\n\n\nOptionally, you may also:\n\nAdd the ability to delete and/or edit birthday entries.\nAdd any additional features of your choosing!\n\nHints\nCreate a form via which users can submit birthdays\nIn index.html, notice the following TODO:\n&lt;!-- TODO: Create a form for users to submit a name, a month, and a day --&gt;\nRecall that, to create a form, you can use the form HTML element. You can create a form HTML element with the following opening and closing tags:\n&lt;form&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\nOf course, a form still needs input fields (and a button via which the user can submit the form!). Recall that HTML input elements create, among other things, input boxes within a form. You can specify their type attribute to allow them to accept text or numbers. Also give the input elements a name attribute so you can differentiate them.\n&lt;form&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"name\" type=\"text\"&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"month\" type=\"number\"&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"day\" type=\"number\"&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\nYour form might benefit from a button the user could click to submit their data. Add an input element of type submit, which will allow the user to do just that. If you’d like the button itself to have explanatory text, try setting the value attribute.\n&lt;form&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"name\" type=\"text\"&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"month\" type=\"number\"&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"day\" type=\"number\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Add Birthday\"&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\nWhere will the user’s data be submitted? Currently, nowhere! Recall that you can specify a form’s action attribute to dictate which route should be requested after the form is submitted. The form data will be submitted along with the resulting request. The method attribute specifies which HTTP request method to use when submitting the form.\n&lt;form action=\"/\" method=\"post\"&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"name\" type=\"text\"&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"month\" type=\"number\"&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"day\" type=\"number\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Add Birthday\"&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\nWith that, your form should be perfectly functional, though it could still be improved! Consider adding placeholder values to spruce things up a bit:\n&lt;form action=\"/\" method=\"post\"&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"name\" placeholder=\"Name\" type=\"text\"&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"month\" placeholder=\"Month\" type=\"number\"&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"day\" placeholder=\"Day\" type=\"number\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Add Birthday\"&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\nAnd consider adding some client-side validation, to ensure the user cooperates with the intent of your form. For example, an input field of type number can also have a min and max attribute specified, which determine the minimum and maximum value a user can enter.\n&lt;form action=\"/\" method=\"post\"&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"name\" placeholder=\"Name\" type=\"text\"&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"month\" placeholder=\"Month\" type=\"number\" min=\"1\" max=\"12\"&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"day\" placeholder=\"Day\" type=\"number\" min=\"1\" max=\"31\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Add Birthday\"&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\nAdd a user’s form submission to the database\nIn app.py, notice the following TODO:\n# TODO: Add the user's entry into the database\nRecall that Flask has some handy methods to access form data submitted via POST! In particular:\n# Access form data\nrequest.form.get(NAME)\nwhere NAME refers to the name attribute of the particular input element with submitted data. If your input elements were named name, month, and day, you could access (and store!) their values respectively with the following:\n# Access form data\nname = request.form.get(\"name\")\nmonth = request.form.get(\"month\")\nday = request.form.get(\"day\")\nNow the values submitted by the user in the name, month, and day input elements are available to you as Python variables.\nThe next step is to add these values to your database! Thanks to this particular line\ndb = SQL(\"sqlite:///birthdays.db\")\napp.py has already established a connection to birthdays.db under the name db. You can now execute SQL queries by calling db.execute with a valid SQL query. If you wanted to add Carter’s birthday on January 1st, you might run the following SQL statement:\nINSERT INTO birthdays (name, month, day) VALUES('Carter', 1, 1);\nConfigure app.py to run that same query, but with placeholders for the values to insert, as follows:\n# Access form data\nname = request.form.get(\"name\")\nmonth = request.form.get(\"month\")\nday = request.form.get(\"day\")\n\n# Insert data into database\ndb.execute(\"INSERT INTO birthdays (name, month, day) VALUES(?, ?, ?)\", name, month, day)\nAnd that should do it! Try submitting the form, opening birthdays.db, and using a SELECT query to view the contents of the birthdays table. You should see the submitted form data available to you.\nAs you create more advanced applications, you’ll also want to add server-side validation: that is, a way to check whether the user’s data is valid before doing anything else! One of the first validations you might make is whether the user submitted any data at all! Should you try to retrieve form data with request.form.get where the user didn’t submit any, request.form.get will return an empty string. You can check for this value in Python as follows:\n# Access form data\nname = request.form.get(\"name\")\nif not name:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\n\nmonth = request.form.get(\"month\")\nif not month:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\n\nday = request.form.get(\"day\")\nif not day:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\n\n# Insert data into database\ndb.execute(\"INSERT INTO birthdays (name, month, day) VALUES(?, ?, ?)\", name, month, day)\nNow, you won’t insert a row until you’re sure the user has provided all the data you need.\nA few more things could still go wrong! What if the user doesn’t, in fact, provide a numeric value for month or day? One way to check is to try to convert the value to an integer with int and, if the conversion fails, to redirect the user back to the homepage.\n# Access form data\nname = request.form.get(\"name\")\nif not name:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\n\nmonth = request.form.get(\"month\")\nif not month:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\ntry:\n    month = int(month)\nexcept ValueError:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\n\nday = request.form.get(\"day\")\nif not day:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\ntry:\n    day = int(day)\nexcept ValueError:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\n\n# Insert data into database\ndb.execute(\"INSERT INTO birthdays (name, month, day) VALUES(?, ?, ?)\", name, month, day)\nAnd even if the user has entered a number, best to check it’s in the right range!\n# Access form data\nname = request.form.get(\"name\")\nif not name:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\n\nmonth = request.form.get(\"month\")\nif not month:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\ntry:\n    month = int(month)\nexcept ValueError:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\nif month &lt; 1 or month &gt; 12:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\n\nday = request.form.get(\"day\")\nif not day:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\ntry:\n    day = int(day)\nexcept ValueError:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\nif day &lt; 1 or day &gt; 31:\n    return redirect(\"/\")\n\n# Insert data into database\ndb.execute(\"INSERT INTO birthdays (name, month, day) VALUES(?, ?, ?)\", name, month, day)\nRender birthdays in birthdays.db\nOnce a user can submit birthdays and store them in birthdays.db, your next task is to ensure those birthdays are rendered in index.html.\nFirst, you’ll need to retrieve all birthdays from birthdays.db. You could so with the SQL query:\nSELECT * FROM birthdays;\nSee the following TODO in app.py:\n# TODO: Display the entries in the database on index.html\nConsider configuring app.py to run this SQL query each time the page is loaded with a GET request:\n# Query for all birthdays\nbirthdays = db.execute(\"SELECT * FROM birthdays\")\nNow, all birthdays in the birthdays table of birthdays.db are available to you in a Python variable named birthdays. In particular, the results of the SQL query are stored as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents one row returned by the query, and each key in the dictionary corresponds to a column name of the birthdays table (i.e., “name”, “month”, and “day”).\nTo render these birthdays in index.html, you can rely on Flask’s render_template function. You can specify that index.html should be rendered with the birthdays variable by specifying a keyword argument, also called birthdays, and setting it equal to the birthdays variable you just recently created.\n# Query for all birthdays\nbirthdays = db.execute(\"SELECT * FROM birthdays\")\n\n# Render birthdays page\nreturn render_template(\"index.html\", birthdays=birthdays)\nTo be clear, the name on the left-hand side of the =, birthdays, is the name under which you can access the birthdays data within index.html itself.\nNow that index.html is being rendered with access to the birthdays data, you can use Jinja to render the data properly. Jinja, like Python, can loop through elements of a list. And Jinja, like Python, can access elements a dictionary by their keys. In this case, the Jinja syntax to do so is the name of the dictionary, followed by a ., then the name of the key to access.\n{% for birthday in birthdays %}\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;/&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n{% endfor %}\nAnd that’s it! Try reloading the page to see the birthdays rendered.\nTesting\nBe sure to test your web application by adding some birthdays and ensuring that the data appears in your table as expected.\nRun flask run in your terminal while in your birthdays directory to start a web server that serves your Flask application."

    "text": "What to do\nSuppose you work at a store and a customer gives you $1.00 (100 cents) for candy that costs $0.50 (50 cents). You’ll need to pay them their “change,” the amount leftover after paying for the cost of the candy. When making change, odds are you want to minimize the number of coins you’re dispensing for each customer, lest you run out (or annoy the customer!). In a file called cash.c in a folder called cash, implement a program in C that prints the minimum coins needed to make the given amount of change, in cents, as in the below:\nChange owed: 25\n1\n\nBut prompt the user for an int greater than 0, so that the program works for any amount of change:\nChange owed: 70\n4\n\nRe-prompt the user, again and again as needed, if their input is not greater than or equal to 0 (or if their input isn’t an int at all!).\nGreedy Algorithms\nFortunately, computer science has given cashiers everywhere ways to minimize numbers of coins due: greedy algorithms.\nAccording to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a greedy algorithm is one “that always takes the best immediate, or local, solution while finding an answer. Greedy algorithms find the overall, or globally, optimal solution for some optimization problems, but may find less-than-optimal solutions for some instances of other problems.”\nWhat’s all that mean? Well, suppose that a cashier owes a customer some change and in that cashier’s drawer are quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢). The problem to be solved is to decide which coins and how many of each to hand to the customer. Think of a “greedy” cashier as one who wants to take the biggest bite out of this problem as possible with each coin they take out of the drawer. For instance, if some customer is owed 41¢, the biggest first (i.e., best immediate, or local) bite that can be taken is 25¢. (That bite is “best” inasmuch as it gets us closer to 0¢ faster than any other coin would.) Note that a bite of this size would whittle what was a 41¢ problem down to a 16¢ problem, since 41 - 25 = 16. That is, the remainder is a similar but smaller problem. Needless to say, another 25¢ bite would be too big (assuming the cashier prefers not to lose money), and so our greedy cashier would move on to a bite of size 10¢, leaving him or her with a 6¢ problem. At that point, greed calls for one 5¢ bite followed by one 1¢ bite, at which point the problem is solved. The customer receives one quarter, one dime, one nickel, and one penny: four coins in total.\nIt turns out that this greedy approach (i.e., algorithm) is not only locally optimal but also globally so for America’s currency (and also the European Union’s). That is, so long as a cashier has enough of each coin, this largest-to-smallest approach will yield the fewest coins possible. How few? Well, you tell us!"

    "text": "Advice\nWrite some code that you know will compile\nEven though this program won’t do anything, it should at least compile with make!\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n\n}\n\nNotice that you’ve now included cs50.h and stdio.h, two “header files” that will give you access to functions that might help you solve this problem.\nWrite some pseudocode before writing more code\nIf unsure how to solve the problem itself, break it down into smaller problems that you can probably solve first. For instance, this problem is really only a handful of problems:\n\nPrompt the user for change owed, in cents.\nCalculate how many quarters you should give customer. Subtract the value of those quarters from cents.\nCalculate how many dimes you should give customer. Subtract the value of those dimes from remaining cents.\nCalculate how many nickels you should give customer. Subtract the value of those nickels from remaining cents.\nCalculate how many pennies you should give customer. Subtract the value of those pennies from remaining cents.\nSum the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies used.\nPrint that sum.\n\nThis is the greedy algorithm you can use to solve this problem, so let’s write some pseudcode as comments to remind you to do just that:\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for change owed, in cents\n\n    // Calculate how many quarters you should give customer\n    // Subtract the value of those quarters from cents\n\n    // Calculate how many dimes you should give customer\n    // Subtract the value of those dimes from remaining cents\n\n    // Calculate how many nickels you should give customer\n    // Subtract the value of those nickels from remaining cents\n\n    // Calculate how many pennies you should give customer\n    // Subtract the value of those pennies from remaining cents\n\n    // Sum the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies used\n    // Print that sum\n}\n\nConvert the pseudocode to code\nFirst, consider how you might prompt the user for the cents they are owed. Recall that a do while loop is helpful when you want to do something at least once, and possibly again and again, as in the below:\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for change owed, in cents\n    int cents;\n    do\n    {\n        cents = get_int(\"Change owed: \");\n    }\n    while (cents &lt; 0);\n}\n\nIt’s wise to stop here and make your program. Test to be sure your program compiles, and that it reprompts you if you enter less than 0 cents (or if you enter an input like “cat”).\nNext, consider how to calculate how many quarters you should give the customer. Since we’re using a greedy algorithm, this question becomes “what’s the greatest number of quarters could you give them?”. You could write a solution to this problem in your main function. But, it might clear up your thinking to write a new function: one called calculate_quarters. That way you can better focus on the logic to calculate quarters. Later, you can integrate this function into your larger solution.\nint calculate_quarters(int cents)\n{\n    // Calculate how many quarters you should give customer\n}\n\nNotice that this function is indeed named calculate_quarters. Per int cents in parentheses, it takes an int called cents as input. And, per the int in front of its name, it should also “return” an int. That is, the output of this function is an integer: the number of quarters that fit into cents. If curious about this idea, recall there are several sample programs in this Week’s Source Code that illustrate how functions can return a value.\nNow consider this way of implementing calculate_quarters by adding to the number of quarters until we’ve run out of cents to convert to quarters:\nint calculate_quarters(int cents)\n{\n    // Calculate how many quarters you should give customer\n    int quarters = 0;\n    while (cents &gt;= 25)\n    {\n        quarters++;\n        cents = cents - 25;\n    }\n    return quarters;\n}\n\nGranted, there is at least one simpler way to solve this calculate_quarters problem. But we’ll leave that up to you to figure out!\nWith calculate_quarters functioning as intended, you can integrate this function into your program. Take care to “declare” the function’s “signature” (i.e., int calculate_quarters(int cents)) above your main function, so you can indeed use calculate_quarters there while defining it later, below main.\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint calculate_quarters(int cents);\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for change owed, in cents\n    int cents;\n    do\n    {\n        cents = get_int(\"Change owed: \");\n    }\n    while (cents &lt; 0);\n\n    // Calculate how many quarters you should give customer\n    int quarters = calculate_quarters(cents);\n\n    // Subtract the value of those quarters from cents\n    cents = cents - (quarters * 25);\n}\n\nint calculate_quarters(int cents)\n{\n    // Calculate how many quarters you should give customer\n    int quarters = 0;\n    while (cents &gt;= 25)\n    {\n        quarters++;\n        cents = cents - 25;\n    }\n    return quarters;\n}\n\nA few problems down, and a few more to go! Notice a pattern you could re-use here?\nHow to Test\nFor this program, try testing your code manually. It’s good practice:\n\nIf you input -1, does your program prompt you again?\nIf you input 0, does your program output 0?\nIf you input 1, does your program output 1 (i.e., one penny)?\nIf you input 4, does your program output 4 (i.e., four pennies)?\nIf you input 5, does your program output 1 (i.e., one nickel)?\nIf you input 24, does your program output 6 (i.e., two dimes and four pennies)?\nIf you input 25, does your program output 1 (i.e., one quarter)?\nIf you input 26, does your program output 2 (i.e., one quarter and one penny)?\nIf you input 99, does your program output 9 (i.e., three quarters, two dimes, and four pennies)?"

For instance, this problem is really only a handful of problems:\n\nPrompt for the user for two words\nCompute the score of each word\nPrint the winner\n\nLet’s write some pseudcode as comments to remind you to do just that:\n#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for two words\n\n    // Compute the score of each word\n\n    // Print the winner\n}\n\nSome problems in homeworks, like this one, might contain spoilers (like the next one) that ultimately walk you through the entire solution. While you are permitted to use this code, we really do strongly encourage you to try things out yourself first! The other problems in the problem set won’t have this sort of walkthrough, and typically the problem that contains the “full spoiler” is a warm-up version of the bigger problem you’ll later need to tackle.\nConvert the pseudocode to code\nFirst, consider how you might prompt the user for two words. Recall that get_string, a function in the CS50 library, can prompt the user for a string.\n#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for two words\n    string word1 = get_string(\"Player 1: \");\n    string word2 = get_string(\"Player 2: \");\n\n    // Compute the score of each word\n\n    // Print the winner\n}\n\nNext consider how to compute the score of each word. Since the same scoring algorithm applies to both words, you have a good opportunity for abstraction. Here we’ll define a function called compute_score that takes a string, called word, as input, and then returns word’s score as an int.\n#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint compute_score(string word);\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for two words\n    string word1 = get_string(\"Player 1: \");\n    string word2 = get_string(\"Player 2: \");\n\n    // Compute the score of each word\n    int score1 = compute_score(word1);\n    int score2 = compute_score(word2);\n\n    // Print the winner   \n}\n\nint compute_score(string word)\n{\n    // Compute and return score for word\n}\n\nNow turn to implementing compute_score. To compute the score of a word, you need to know the point value of each letter in the word. You can associate letters and their point values with an array. Imagine an array of 26 ints, called POINTS, in which the first number is the point value for ‘A’, the second number is the point value for ‘B’, and so on. By declaring and initializing such an array outside of any single function, you can ensure this array is accessible to any function, including compute_score.\n#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\n// Points assigned to each letter of the alphabet\nint POINTS[] = {1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10};\n\nint compute_score(string word);\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for two words\n    string word1 = get_string(\"Player 1: \");\n    string word2 = get_string(\"Player 2: \");\n\n    // Compute the score of each word\n    int score1 = compute_score(word1);\n    int score2 = compute_score(word2);\n\n    // Print the winner   \n}\n\nint compute_score(string word)\n{\n    // Compute and return score for word\n}\n\nTo implement compute_score, first try to find the point value of a single letter in word.\n\nRecall that to find the character at the nth index of a string, s, you can write s[n]. So word[0], for example, will give you the first character of word.\nNow, recall that computers represent characters using ASCII, a standard that represents each character as a number.\nRecall too that the 0th index of POINTS, POINTS[0], gives you the point value of ‘A’. Think about how you could transform the numeric representation of ‘A’ into the index of its point value. Now, what about ‘a’? You’ll need to apply different transformations to upper- and lower-case letters, so you may find the functions isupper and islower to be helpful to you.\nKeep in mind that characters that are not letters should be given zero points For example, ! is worth 0 points.\n\nIf you can properly calculate the value of one character in words, odds are you can use a loop to sum the points for the rest of the characters. Once you’ve tried the above on your own, consider this (quite revealing!) hint below.\n#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\n// Points assigned to each letter of the alphabet\nint POINTS[] = {1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10};\n\nint compute_score(string word);\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for two words\n    string word1 = get_string(\"Player 1: \");\n    string word2 = get_string(\"Player 2: \");\n\n    // Compute the score of each word\n    int score1 = compute_score(word1);\n    int score2 = compute_score(word2);\n\n    // Print the winner   \n}\n\nint compute_score(string word)\n{\n    // Keep track of score\n    int score = 0;\n\n    // Compute score for each character\n    for (int i = 0, len = strlen(word); i &lt; len; i++)\n    {\n        if (isupper(word[i]))\n        {\n            score += POINTS[word[i] - 'A'];\n        }\n        else if (islower(word[i]))\n        {\n            score += POINTS[word[i] - 'a'];\n        }\n    }\n\n    return score;\n}\n\nFinally, finish your pseudocode’s last step: printing the winner. Recall that an if statement can be used to check if a condition is true, and that the additional usage of else if or else can check for other (exclusive) conditions.\nif (/* Player 1 wins */)\n{\n    // ...\n}\nelse if (/* Player 2 wins */)\n{\n    // ...\n}\nelse\n{\n    // ...\n}\n\nAnd once you’ve tried the above, feel free to take a peek at the hint (or, rather, complete solution!) below.\n#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\n#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\n// Points assigned to each letter of the alphabet\nint POINTS[] = {1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10};\n\nint compute_score(string word);\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // Prompt the user for two words\n    string word1 = get_string(\"Player 1: \");\n    string word2 = get_string(\"Player 2: \");\n\n    // Compute the score of each word\n    int score1 = compute_score(word1);\n    int score2 = compute_score(word2);\n\n    // Print the winner   \n    if (score1 &gt; score2)\n    {\n        printf(\"Player 1 wins!\\n\");\n    }\n    else if (score1 &lt; score2)\n    {\n        printf(\"Player 2 wins!\\n\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        printf(\"Tie!\\n\");\n    }\n}\n\nint compute_score(string word)\n{\n    // Keep track of score\n    int score = 0;\n\n    // Compute score for each character\n    for (int i = 0, len = strlen(word); i &lt; len; i++)\n    {\n        if (isupper(word[i]))\n        {\n            score += POINTS[word[i] - 'A'];\n        }\n        else if (islower(word[i]))\n        {\n            score += POINTS[word[i] - 'a'];\n        }\n    }\n\n    return score;\n}\n\nHow to Test\nYour program should behave per the examples below.\n$ ./scrabble\nPlayer 1: Question?\nPlayer 2: Question!\nTie!\n\n$ ./scrabble\nPlayer 1: red\nPlayer 2: wheelbarrow\nPlayer 2 wins!\n\n$ ./scrabble\nPlayer 1: COMPUTER\nPlayer 2: science\nPlayer 1 wins!\n\n$ ./scrabble\nPlayer 1: Scrabble\nPlayer 2: wiNNeR\nPlayer 1 wins!"

    "section": "What to do",
    "text": "What to do\nSupposedly, Caesar (yes, THAT Caesar) used to “encrypt” (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) confidential messages by shifting each letter therein by some number of places. For instance, he might write A as B, B as C, C as D, …, and, wrapping around alphabetically, Z as A. And so, to say HELLO to someone, Caesar might write IFMMP instead. Upon receiving such messages from Caesar, recipients would have to “decrypt” them by shifting letters in the opposite direction by the same number of places.\nThe secrecy of this “cryptosystem” relied on only Caesar and the recipients knowing a secret, the number of places by which Caesar had shifted his letters (e.g., 1). Not particularly secure by modern standards, but, hey, if you’re perhaps the first in the world to do it, pretty secure!\nUnencrypted text is generally called plaintext. Encrypted text is generally called ciphertext. And the secret used is called a key.\nTo be clear, then, here’s how encrypting HELLO with a key of (1) yields IFMMP:\n\n\n\nplaintext\nH\nE\nL\nL\nO\n\n\n\n\n+ key\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n\n\n= ciphertext\nI\nF\nM\nM\nP\n\n\n\nMore formally, Caesar’s algorithm (i.e., cipher) encrypts messages by “rotating” each letter by (k) positions. More formally, if (p) is some plaintext (i.e., an unencrypted message), (p_i) is the (i^{th}) character in (p), and (k) is a secret key (i.e., a non-negative integer), then each letter, (c_i), in the ciphertext, (c), is computed as\n[c_i = (p_i + k)%]\nwherein (%) here means “remainder when dividing by 26.” This formula perhaps makes the cipher seem more complicated than it is, but it’s really just a concise way of expressing the algorithm precisely. Indeed, for the sake of discussion, think of A (or a) as (0), B (or b) as (1), …, H (or h) as (7), I (or i) as (8), …, and Z (or z) as (25). Suppose that Caesar just wants to say Hi to someone confidentially using, this time, a key, (k), of 3. And so his plaintext, (p), is Hi, in which case his plaintext’s first character, (p_0), is H (aka 7), and his plaintext’s second character, (p_1), is i (aka 8). His ciphertext’s first character, (c_0), is thus K, and his ciphertext’s second character, (c_1), is thus L. Make sense?\nIn a file called caesar.c in a folder called caesar, write a program that enables you to encrypt messages using Caesar’s cipher. At the time the user executes the program, they should decide, by providing a command-line argument, what the key should be in the secret message they’ll provide at runtime. We shouldn’t necessarily assume that the user’s key is going to be a number; though you may assume that, if it is a number, it will be a positive integer.\nSpecification\nDesign and implement a program, caesar, that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher.\n\nImplement your program in a file called caesar.c in a directory called caesar.\nYour program must accept a single command-line argument, a non-negative integer. Let’s call it (k) for the sake of discussion.\nIf your program is executed without any command-line arguments or with more than one command-line argument, your program should print an error message of your choice (with printf) and return from main a value of 1 (which tends to signify an error) immediately.\nIf any of the characters of the command-line argument is not a decimal digit, your program should print the message Usage: ./caesar key and return from main a value of 1.\nDo not assume that (k) will be less than or equal to 26. Your program should work for all non-negative integral values of (k) less than (2^{31} - 26). In other words, you don’t need to worry if your program eventually breaks if the user chooses a value for (k) that’s too big or almost too big to fit in an int. (Recall that an int can overflow.) But, even if (k) is greater than (26), alphabetical characters in your program’s input should remain alphabetical characters in your program’s output. For instance, if (k) is (27), A should not become \\ even though \\ is (27) positions away from A in ASCII, per asciitable.com; A should become B, since B is (27) positions away from A, provided you wrap around from Z to A.\nYour program must output plaintext: (with two spaces but without a newline) and then prompt the user for a string of plaintext (using get_string).\nYour program must output ciphertext: (with one space but without a newline) followed by the plaintext’s corresponding ciphertext, with each alphabetical character in the plaintext “rotated” by k positions; non-alphabetical characters should be outputted unchanged.\nYour program must preserve case: capitalized letters, though rotated, must remain capitalized letters; lowercase letters, though rotated, must remain lowercase letters.\nAfter outputting ciphertext, you should print a newline. Your program should then exit by returning 0 from main."

    "section": "Advice",
    "text": "Advice\nHow to begin? Let’s approach this problem one step at a time.\nPseudocode\nFirst write, try to write a main function in caesar.c that implements the program using just pseudocode, even if not (yet!) sure how to write it in actual code.\nHint\nThere’s more than one way to do this, so here’s just one!\nint main(int argc, string argv[])\n{\n    // Make sure program was run with just one command-line argument\n\n    // Make sure every character in argv[1] is a digit\n\n    // Convert argv[1] from a `string` to an `int`\n\n    // Prompt user for plaintext\n\n    // For each character in the plaintext:\n\n        // Rotate the character if it's a letter\n}\n\nIt’s okay to edit your own pseudocode after seeing ours here, but don’t simply copy/paste ours into your own!\nCounting Command-Line Arguments\nWhatever your pseudocode, let’s first write only the C code that checks whether the program was run with a single command-line argument before adding additional functionality.\nSpecifically, modify main in caesar.c in such a way that, if the user provides no command-line arguments, or two or more, the function prints \"Usage: ./caesar key\\n\" and then returns 1, effectively exiting the program. If the user provides exactly one command-line argument, the program should print nothing and simply return 0. The program should thus behave per the below.\n$ ./caesar\nUsage: ./caesar key\n\n$ ./caesar 1 2 3\nUsage: ./caesar key\n\n$ ./caesar 1\n\nHints\n\nRecall that you can print with printf.\nRecall that a function can return a value with return.\nRecall that argc contains the number of command-line arguments passed to a program, plus the program’s own name.\n\nChecking the Key\nNow that your program is (hopefully!) accepting input as prescribed, it’s time for another step.\nAdd to caesar.c, below main, a function called, e.g., only_digits that takes a string as an argument and returns true if that string contains only digits, 0 through 9, else it returns false. Be sure to add the function’s prototype above main as well.\nHints\n\nOdds are you’ll want a prototype like:\nbool only_digits(string s);\n\nAnd be sure to include the cs50.h library atop your file, so that the compiler recognizes string (and bool).\nRecall that a string is just an array of chars.\nRecall that strlen, declared in string.h, calculates the length of a string.\nYou might find isdigit, declared in ctype.h, to be helpful, per manual.cs50.io. But note that it only checks one char at a time!\n\nThen modify main in such a way that it calls only_digits on argv[1]. If that function returns false, then main should print \"Usage: ./caesar key\\n\" and return 1. Else main should simply return 0. The program should thus behave per the below:\n$ ./caesar 42\n\n$ ./caesar banana\nUsage: ./caesar key\n\nUsing the Key\nNow modify main in such a way that it converts argv[1] to an int. You might find atoi, declared in stdlib.h, to be helpful, per manual.cs50.io. And then use get_string to prompt the user for some plaintext with \"plaintext: \".\nThen, implement a function called, e.g., rotate, that takes a char as input and also an int, and rotates that char by that many positions if it’s a letter (i.e., alphabetical), wrapping around from Z to A (and from z to a) as needed. If the char is not a letter, the function should instead return the same char unchanged.\nHints\n\nOdds are you’ll want a prototype like:\nchar rotate(char c, int n);\n\nA function call like\nrotate('A', 1)\n\nor even\nrotate('A', 27)\n\nshould thus return 'B'. And a function call like\nrotate('!', 13)\n\nshould return '!'.\nRecall that you can explicitly “cast” a char to an int with (int), and an int to a char with (char). Or you can do so implicitly by simply treating one as the other.\nOdds are you’ll want to subtract the ASCII value of 'A' from any uppercase letters, so as to treat 'A' as 0, 'B' as 1, and so forth, while performing arithmetic. And then add it back when done with the same.\nOdds are you’ll want to subtract the ASCII value of 'a' from any lowercase letters, so as to treat 'a' as 0, 'b' as 1, and so forth, while performing arithmetic. And then add it back when done with the same.\nYou might find some other functions declared in ctype.h to be helpful, per manual.cs50.io.\nOdds are you’ll find % helpful when “wrapping around” arithmetically from a value like 25 to 0.\n\nThen modify main in such a way that it prints \"ciphertext: \" and then iterates over every char in the user’s plaintext, calling rotate on each, and printing the return value thereof.\nMore Hints\n\nRecall that printf can print a char using %c.\nIf you’re not seeing any output at all when you call printf, odds are it’s because you’re printing characters outside of the valid ASCII range from 0 to 127. Try printing characters temporarily as numbers (using %i instead of %c) to see what values you’re printing!"

    "text": "Elections come in all shapes and sizes. In the UK, the Prime Minister is officially appointed by the monarch, who generally chooses the leader of the political party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons. The United States uses a multi-step Electoral College process where citizens vote on how each state should allocate Electors who then elect the President.\nPerhaps the simplest way to hold an election, though, is via a method commonly known as the “plurality vote” (also known as “first-past-the-post” or “winner take all”). In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.\nFor this problem, you’ll implement a program that runs a plurality election, per the below.\nDistribution Code\nFor this problem, you’ll extend the functionality of “distribution code” provided to you by the course staff.\nDownload the distribution code.\nOpen the homework codespace.\n$\nNext execute\nwget https://github.com/SQ4007-2025/website/raw/refs/heads/master/homework/data/plurality.zip\nin order to download a ZIP called plurality.zip into your codespace.\nThen execute\nunzip plurality.zip\nto create a folder called plurality. You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute\nrm plurality.zip\nand respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP file you downloaded.\nNow type\ncd plurality\nfollowed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.\nplurality/ $\n\nIf all was successful, you should execute\nls\n\nand see a file named plurality.c. Executing code plurality.c should open the file where you will type your code for this problem set. If not, retrace your steps and see if you can determine where you went wrong!\nUnderstand the code in plurality.c\nWhenever you’ll extend the functionality of existing code, it’s best to be sure you first understand it in its present state.\nLook first at the top of the file. The line #define MAX 9 is some syntax used here to mean that MAX is a constant (equal to 9) that can be used throughout the program. Here, it represents the maximum number of candidates an election can have.\n// Max number of candidates\n#define MAX 9\n\nNotice that plurality.c then uses this constant to define a global array—that is, an array that any function can access.\n// Array of candidates\ncandidate candidates[MAX];\n\nBut what, in this case, is a candidate? In plurality.c, a candidate is a struct. Each candidate has two fields: a string called name representing the candidate’s name, and an int called votes representing the number of votes the candidate has.\n// Candidates have name and vote count\ntypedef struct\n{\n    string name;\n    int votes;\n}\ncandidate;\n\nNow, take a look at the main function itself.

    "text": "Elections come in all shapes and sizes. In the UK, the Prime Minister is officially appointed by the monarch, who generally chooses the leader of the political party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons. The United States uses a multi-step Electoral College process where citizens vote on how each state should allocate Electors who then elect the President.\nPerhaps the simplest way to hold an election, though, is via a method commonly known as the “plurality vote” (also known as “first-past-the-post” or “winner take all”). In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.\nFor this problem, you’ll implement a program that runs a plurality election, per the below.\nDistribution Code\nFor this problem, you’ll extend the functionality of “distribution code” provided to you by the course staff.\nDownload the distribution code.\nOpen the homework codespace.\n$\nNext execute\nwget https://github.com/SQ4007-2025/website/raw/refs/heads/master/homework/data/plurality.zip\nin order to download a ZIP called plurality.zip into your codespace.\nThen execute\nunzip plurality.zip\nto create a folder called plurality.

Your prompt should now resemble the below.\nplurality/ $\n\nIf all was successful, you should execute\nls\n\nand see a file named plurality.c. Executing code plurality.c should open the file where you will type your code for this problem set. If not, retrace your steps and see if you can determine where you went wrong!\nUnderstand the code in plurality.c\nWhenever you’ll extend the functionality of existing code, it’s best to be sure you first understand it in its present state.\nLook first at the top of the file. The line #define MAX 9 is some syntax used here to mean that MAX is a constant (equal to 9) that can be used throughout the program. Here, it represents the maximum number of candidates an election can have.\n// Max number of candidates\n#define MAX 9\n\nNotice that plurality.c then uses this constant to define a global array—that is, an array that any function can access.\n// Array of candidates\ncandidate candidates[MAX];\n\nBut what, in this case, is a candidate? In plurality.c, a candidate is a struct. Each candidate has two fields: a string called name representing the candidate’s name, and an int called votes representing the number of votes the candidate has.\n// Candidates have name and vote count\ntypedef struct\n{\n    string name;\n    int votes;\n}\ncandidate;\n\nNow, take a look at the main function itself. See if you can find where the program sets a global variable candidate_count representing the number of candidates in the election.\n// Number of candidates\nint candidate_count;\n\nWhat about where it copies command-line arguments into the array candidates?\n// Populate array of candidates\ncandidate_count = argc - 1;\nif (candidate_count &gt; MAX)\n{\n    printf(\"Maximum number of candidates is %i\\n\", MAX);\n    return 2;\n}\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; candidate_count; i++)\n{\n    candidates[i].name = argv[i + 1];\n    candidates[i].votes = 0;\n}\n\nAnd where it asks the user to type in the number of voters?\nint voter_count = get_int(\"Number of voters: \");\n\nThen, the program lets every voter type in a vote, calling the vote function on each candidate voted for. Finally, main makes a call to the print_winner function to print out the winner (or winners) of the election. We’ll leave it to you to identify the code that implements this functionality.\nIf you look further down in the file, though, you’ll notice that the vote and print_winner functions have been left blank.\n// Update vote totals given a new vote\nbool vote(string name)\n{\n    // TODO\n    return false;\n}\n\n// Print the winner (or winners) of the election\nvoid print_winner(void)\n{\n    // TODO\n    return;\n}\n\nThis part is up to you to complete! You should not modify anything else in plurality.c other than the implementations of the vote and print_winner functions (and the inclusion of additional header files, if you’d like)."

    "text": "Problem to Solve\nYou already know about plurality elections, which follow a very simple algorithm for determining the winner of an election: every voter gets one vote, and the candidate with the most votes wins.\nBut the plurality vote does have some disadvantages. What happens, for instance, in an election with three candidates, and the ballots below are cast?\n\n\n\nFive ballots, tie betweeen Alice and Bob\n\n\nA plurality vote would here declare a tie between Alice and Bob, since each has two votes. But is that the right outcome?\nThere’s another kind of voting system known as a ranked-choice voting system. In a ranked-choice system, voters can vote for more than one candidate. Instead of just voting for their top choice, they can rank the candidates in order of preference. The resulting ballots might therefore look like the below.\n\n\n\nFive ballots, with ranked preferences\n\n\nHere, each voter, in addition to specifying their first preference candidate, has also indicated their second and third choices. And now, what was previously a tied election could now have a winner. The race was originally tied between Alice and Bob. But the voter who chose Charlie preferred Alice over Bob, so Alice could here be declared the winner.\nRanked choice voting can also solve yet another potential drawback of plurality voting. Take a look at the following ballots.\n\n\n\nNine ballots, with ranked preferences\n\n\nWho should win this election? In a plurality vote where each voter chooses their first preference only, Charlie wins this election with four votes compared to only three for Bob and two for Alice. (Note that, if you’re familiar with the instant runoff voting system, Charlie wins here under that system as well). Alice, however, might reasonably make the argument that she should be the winner of the election instead of Charlie: after all, of the nine voters, a majority (five of them) preferred Alice over Charlie, so most people would be happier with Alice as the winner instead of Charlie.\nAlice is, in this election, the so-called “Condorcet winner” of the election: the person who would have won any head-to-head matchup against another candidate. If the election had been just Alice and Bob, or just Alice and Charlie, Alice would have won.\nThe Tideman voting method (also known as “ranked pairs”) is a ranked-choice voting method that’s guaranteed to produce the Condorcet winner of the election if one exists. In a file called tideman.c in a folder called tideman, create a program to simulate an election by the Tideman voting method."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nGenerally speaking, the Tideman method works by constructing a “graph” of candidates, where an arrow (i.e. edge) from candidate A to candidate B indicates that candidate A wins against candidate B in a head-to-head matchup. The graph for the above election, then, would look like the below.\n\n\n\nNine ballots, with ranked preferences\n\n\nThe arrow from Alice to Bob means that more voters prefer Alice to Bob (5 prefer Alice, 4 prefer Bob). Likewise, the other arrows mean that more voters prefer Alice to Charlie, and more voters prefer Charlie to Bob.\nLooking at this graph, the Tideman method says the winner of the election should be the “source” of the graph (i.e. the candidate that has no arrow pointing at them). In this case, the source is Alice — Alice is the only one who has no arrow pointing at her, which means nobody is preferred head-to-head over Alice. Alice is thus declared the winner of the election.\nIt’s possible, however, that when the arrows are drawn, there is no Condorcet winner. Consider the below ballots.\n\n\n\nNine ballots, with ranked preferences\n\n\nBetween Alice and Bob, Alice is preferred over Bob by a 7-2 margin. Between Bob and Charlie, Bob is preferred over Charlie by a 5-4 margin. But between Charlie and Alice, Charlie is preferred over Alice by a 6-3 margin. If we draw out the graph, there is no source! We have a cycle of candidates, where Alice beats Bob who beats Charlie who beats Alice (much like a game of rock-paper-scissors). In this case, it looks like there’s no way to pick a winner.\nTo handle this, the Tideman algorithm must be careful to avoid creating cycles in the candidate graph. How does it do this? The algorithm locks in the strongest edges first, since those are arguably the most significant. In particular, the Tideman algorithm specifies that matchup edges should be “locked in” to the graph one at a time, based on the “strength” of the victory (the more people who prefer a candidate over their opponent, the stronger the victory). So long as the edge can be locked into the graph without creating a cycle, the edge is added; otherwise, the edge is ignored.\nHow would this work in the case of the votes above? Well, the biggest margin of victory for a pair is Alice beating Bob, since 7 voters prefer Alice over Bob (no other head-to-head matchup has a winner preferred by more than 7 voters). So the Alice-Bob arrow is locked into the graph first. The next biggest margin of victory is Charlie’s 6-3 victory over Alice, so that arrow is locked in next.\nNext up is Bob’s 5-4 victory over Charlie. But notice: if we were to add an arrow from Bob to Charlie now, we would create a cycle! Since the graph can’t allow cycles, we should skip this edge, and not add it to the graph at all. If there were more arrows to consider, we would look to those next, but that was the last arrow, so the graph is complete.\nThis step-by-step process is shown below, with the final graph at right.\n\n\n\nNine ballots, with ranked preferences\n\n\nBased on the resulting graph, Charlie is the source (there’s no arrow pointing towards Charlie), so Charlie is declared the winner of this election.\nPut more formally, the Tideman voting method consists of three parts:\n\nTally: Once all of the voters have indicated all of their preferences, determine, for each pair of candidates, who the preferred candidate is and by what margin they are preferred.\nSort: Sort the pairs of candidates in decreasing order of strength of victory, where strength of victory is defined to be the number of voters who prefer the preferred candidate.\nLock: Starting with the strongest pair, go through the pairs of candidates in order and “lock in” each pair to the candidate graph, so long as locking in that pair does not create a cycle in the graph.\n\nOnce the graph is complete, the source of the graph (the one with no edges pointing towards it) is the winner!"

The integer preferences[i][j] will represent the number of voters who prefer candidate i over candidate j.\nThe file also defines another two-dimensional array, called locked, which will represent the candidate graph. locked is a boolean array, so locked[i][j] being true represents the existence of an edge pointing from candidate i to candidate j; false means there is no edge. (If curious, this representation of a graph is known as an “adjacency matrix”).\nNext up is a struct called pair, used to represent a pair of candidates: each pair includes the winner’s candidate index and the loser’s candidate index.\nThe candidates themselves are stored in the array candidates, which is an array of strings representing the names of each of the candidates. There’s also an array of pairs, which will represent all of the pairs of candidates (for which one is preferred over the other) in the election.\nThe program also has two global variables: pair_count and candidate_count, representing the number of pairs and number of candidates in the arrays pairs and candidates, respectively.\nNow onto main. Notice that after determining the number of candidates, the program loops through the locked graph and initially sets all of the values to false, which means our initial graph will have no edges in it.\nNext, the program loops over all of the voters and collects their preferences in an array called ranks (via a call to vote), where ranks[i] is the index of the candidate who is the ith preference for the voter. These ranks are passed into the record_preference function, whose job it is to take those ranks and update the global preferences variable.\nOnce all of the votes are in, the pairs of candidates are added to the pairs array via a called to add_pairs, sorted via a call to sort_pairs, and locked into the graph via a call to lock_pairs. Finally, print_winner is called to print out the name of the election’s winner!\nFurther down in the file, you’ll see that the functions vote, record_preference, add_pairs,sort_pairs, lock_pairs, and print_winner are left blank.

Whenever you call fopen, you should later call fclose!\n// Close files\nfclose(input);\nfclose(output);\nBefore closing the files, though, notice that we have a few TODOs.\n// TODO: Copy header from input file to output file\n\n// TODO: Read samples from input file and write updated data to output file\nOdds are you’ll need to know the factor by which to scale the volume, hence why volume.c already converts the third command-line argument to a float for you!\nfloat factor = atof(argv[3]);\nCopy WAV header from input file to output file\nYour first TODO is to copy the WAV file header from input and write it to output. First, though, you’ll need to learn about a few special data types.\nSo far, we’ve seen a number of different types in C, including int, bool, char, double, float, and long. However, inside a header file called stdint.h are the declarations of a number of other types that allow us to very precisely define the size (in bits) and sign (signed or unsigned) of an integer. Two types in particular will be useful to us when working with WAV files:\n\nuint8_t is a type that stores an 8-bit (hence 8!) unsigned (i.e., not negative) integer (hence uint!). We can treat each byte of a WAV file’s header as a uint8_t value.\nint16_t is a type that stores a 16-bit signed (i.e., positive or negative) integer. We can treat each sample of audio in a WAV file as an int16_t value.\n\nYou’ll likely want to create an array of bytes to store the data from the WAV file header that you’ll read from the input file. Using the uint8_t type to represent a byte, you can create an array of n bytes for your header with syntax like\nuint8_t header[n];\nreplacing n with the number of bytes. You can then use header as an argument to fread or fwrite to read into or write from the header.\nRecall that a WAV file’s header is always exactly 44 bytes long. Note that volume.c already defines a variable for you called HEADER_SIZE, equal to the number of bytes in the header.\nThe below is a pretty big hint, but here’s how you could accomplish this TODO!\n// Copy header from input file to output file\nuint8_t header[HEADER_SIZE];\nfread(header, HEADER_SIZE, 1, input);\nfwrite(header, HEADER_SIZE, 1, output);\nWrite updated data to output file\nYour next TODO is to read samples from input, update those samples, and write the updated samples to output. When reading files, it’s common to create a “buffer” in which to temporarily store data. There, you can modify the data and—once it’s ready—write the buffer’s data to a new file.\nRecall that we can use the int16_t type to represent a sample of a WAV file. To store an audio sample, then, you can create a buffer variable with syntax like:\n// Create a buffer for a single sample\nint16_t buffer;\nWith a buffer for samples in place, you can now read data into it, one sample at a time. Try using fread for this task! You can use &buffer, the address of buffer, as an argument to fread or fwrite to read into or write from the buffer. (Recall that the & operator is used to get the address of the variable.)\n// Create a buffer for a single sample\nint16_t buffer;\n\n// Read single sample into buffer\nfread(&buffer, sizeof(int16_t), 1, input);\nNow, to increase (or decrease) the volume of a sample, you need only multiply it by some factor.\n// Create a buffer for a single sample\nint16_t buffer;\n\n// Read single sample into buffer\nfread(&buffer, sizeof(int16_t), 1, input);\n\n// Update volume of sample\nbuffer *= factor;\nAnd finally, you can write that updated sample to output:\n// Create a buffer for a single sample\nint16_t buffer;\n\n// Read single sample from input into buffer\nfread(&buffer, sizeof(int16_t), 1, input);\n\n// Update volume of sample\nbuffer *= factor;\n\n// Write updated sample to new file\nfwrite(&buffer, sizeof(int16_t), 1, output);\nThere’s just one problem: you’ll need to continue reading a sample into your buffer, updating its volume, and writing the updated sample to the output file while there are still samples left to read.\n\nThankfully, per its documentation, fread will return the number of items of data successfully read. You may find this useful to check for when you’ve reached the end of the file!\nKeep in mind there’s no reason you can’t call fread inside of a while loop’s conditional. You could, for example, make a call to fread like the following:\nwhile (fread(...))\n{\n\n}\n\nIt’s quite the hint, but see the below for an efficient way to solve this problem:\n// Create a buffer for a single sample\nint16_t buffer;\n\n// Read single sample from input into buffer while there are samples left to read\nwhile (fread(&buffer, sizeof(int16_t), 1, input) != 0)\n{\n    // Update volume of sample\n    buffer *= factor;\n\n    // Write updated sample to new file\n    fwrite(&buffer, sizeof(int16_t), 1, output);\n}\nBecause the version of C you’re using treats non-zero values as true and zero values as false, you could simplify the above syntax to the following:\n// Create a buffer for a single sample\nint16_t buffer;\n\n// Read single sample from input into buffer while there are samples left to read\nwhile (fread(&buffer, sizeof(int16_t), 1, input))\n{\n    // Update volume of sample\n    buffer *= factor;\n\n    // Write updated sample to new file\n    fwrite(&buffer, sizeof(int16_t), 1, output);\n}"

    "text": "What to do\nIn anticipation of this problem, we have several photos from a university campus, all of which were saved on a digital camera as JPEGs on a memory card. Unfortunately, we somehow deleted them all! Thankfully, in the computer world, “deleted” tends not to mean “deleted” so much as “forgotten.” Even though the camera insists that the card is now blank, we’re pretty sure that’s not quite true. Indeed, we’re hoping (er, expecting!) you can write a program that recovers the photos for us!\nIn a file called recover.c in a folder called recover, write a program to recover JPEGs from a memory card.\nFor this problem, you’ll extend the functionality of code provided to you by CS50’s staff.\nDownload the distribution code\nLog into the homework codespace, click on your terminal window, and execute cd by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:\n$\nNext execute\nwget https://github.com/SQ4007-2025/website/raw/refs/heads/master/homework/data/recover.zip\nin order to download a ZIP called recover.zip into your codespace.\nThen execute\nunzip recover.zip\nto create a folder called recover. You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute\nrm recover.zip\nand respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP file you downloaded.\nNow type\ncd recover\nfollowed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.\nrecover/ $\nExecute ls by itself, and you should see two files: recover.c and card.raw.\nBackground\nEven though JPEGs are more complicated than BMPs, JPEGs have “signatures,” patterns of bytes that can distinguish them from other file formats. Specifically, the first three bytes of JPEGs are\n0xff 0xd8 0xff\nfrom first byte to third byte, left to right. The fourth byte, meanwhile, is either 0xe0, 0xe1, 0xe2, 0xe3, 0xe4, 0xe5, 0xe6, 0xe7, 0xe8, 0xe9, 0xea, 0xeb, 0xec, 0xed, 0xee, or 0xef. Put another way, the fourth byte’s first four bits are 1110.\nOdds are, if you find this pattern of four bytes on media known to store photos (e.g., my memory card), they demarcate the start of a JPEG. To be fair, you might encounter these patterns on some disk purely by chance, so data recovery isn’t an exact science.\nFortunately, digital cameras tend to store photographs contiguously on memory cards, whereby each photo is stored immediately after the previously taken photo. Accordingly, the start of a JPEG usually demarks the end of another. However, digital cameras often initialize cards with a FAT file system whose “block size” is 512 bytes (B). The implication is that these cameras only write to those cards in units of 512 B. A photo that’s 1 MB (i.e., 1,048,576 B) thus takes up 1048576 ÷ 512 = 2048 “blocks” on a memory card. But so does a photo that’s, say, one byte smaller (i.e., 1,048,575 B)! The wasted space on disk is called “slack space.” Forensic investigators often look at slack space for remnants of suspicious data.\nThe implication of all these details is that you, the investigator, can probably write a program that iterates over a copy of my memory card, looking for JPEGs’ signatures. Each time you find a signature, you can open a new file for writing and start filling that file with bytes from my memory card, closing that file only once you encounter another signature. Moreover, rather than read my memory card’s bytes one at a time, you can read 512 of them at a time into a buffer for efficiency’s sake. Thanks to FAT, you can trust that JPEGs’ signatures will be “block-aligned.” That is, you need only look for those signatures in a block’s first four bytes.\nRealize, of course, that JPEGs can span contiguous blocks. Otherwise, no JPEG could be larger than 512 B. But the last byte of a JPEG might not fall at the very end of a block. Recall the possibility of slack space. But not to worry. Because this memory card was brand-new when I started snapping photos, odds are it’d been “zeroed” (i.e., filled with 0s) by the manufacturer, in which case any slack space will be filled with 0s. It’s okay if those trailing 0s end up in the JPEGs you recover; they should still be viewable.\nNow, I only have one memory card, but there are a lot of you! And so I’ve gone ahead and created a “forensic image” of the card, storing its contents, byte after byte, in a file called card.raw. So that you don’t waste time iterating over millions of 0s unnecessarily, I’ve only imaged the first few megabytes of the memory card. But you should ultimately find that the image contains 50 JPEGs.\nSpecification\nImplement a program called recover that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image.\n\nImplement your program in a file called recover.c in a directory called recover.\nYour program should accept exactly one command-line argument, the name of a forensic image from which to recover JPEGs.\nIf your program is not executed with exactly one command-line argument, it should remind the user of correct usage, and main should return 1.\nIf the forensic image cannot be opened for reading, your program should inform the user as much, and main should return 1.\nThe files you generate should each be named ###.jpg, where ### is a three-digit decimal number, starting with 000 for the first image and counting up.\nYour program, if it uses malloc, must not leak any memory."

    "text": "Advice\nWrite some pseudocode before writing more code\nIf unsure how to solve the larger problem, break it down into smaller problems that you can probably solve first. For instance, this problem is really only a handful of problems:\n\nAccept a single command-line argument: the name of a memory card\nOpen the memory card\nWhile there’s still data left to read in the memory card\n\nCreate JPEGs from the data\n\n\nLet’s write some pseudcode as comments to remind you to do just that:\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    // Accept a single command-line argument\n\n    // Open the memory card\n\n    // While there's still data left to read from the memory card\n\n        // Create JPEGs from the data\n}\nConvert the pseudocode to code\nFirst, consider how to accept a single command-line argument. If the user misuses the program, you should tell them the program’s proper usage.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    // Accept a single command-line argument\n    if (argc != 2)\n    {\n        printf(\"Usage: ./recover FILE\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Open the memory card\n\n    // While there's still data left to read from the memory card\n\n        // Create JPEGs from the data\n}\nNow that you’ve checked for proper usage, you can open the memory card. Keep in mind that you can open card.raw programmatically with fopen, as with the below.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    // Accept a single command-line argument\n    if (argc != 2)\n    {\n        printf(\"Usage: ./recover FILE\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Open the memory card\n    FILE *card = fopen(argv[1], \"r\");\n\n    // While there's still data left to read from the memory card\n\n        // Create JPEGs from the data\n}\nYou should, of course, check to be sure the file was opened properly! If it wasn’t, tell the user and exit the program: we’ll leave this part up to you.\nNext, your program should read the data from the card you’ve opened, until there is no longer any data to read. Along the way, your program should recover every one of the JPEGs from card.raw, storing each as a separate file in your current working directory.\nFirst consider how to read card.raw all the way through. Recall that, to read data from a file, you need to temporarily store that data in a “buffer.” And recall further that card.raw stores data in blocks of 512 bytes. As such, you’ll likely want to create a buffer of 512 bytes to store blocks of data as you read them sequentially. One way of doing so is to use the uint8_t type from stdint.h, which stores exactly 8 bits (1 byte). The type is called uint8_t since it stores an unsigned/positive/non-negative integer that requires 8 bits of space (i.e., one byte).\n#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    // Accept a single command-line argument\n    if (argc != 2)\n    {\n        printf(\"Usage: ./recover FILE\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Open the memory card\n    FILE *card = fopen(argv[1], \"r\");\n\n    // Create a buffer for a block of data\n    uint8_t buffer[512];\n\n    // While there's still data left to read from the memory card\n\n        // Create JPEGs from the data\n}\nIt’s probably not the best idea, though, to use 512 as a “magic number” here. Odds are you could improve this design further!\nNow, consider how to read data from the memory card. Per its manual page, fread returns the number of bytes that it has read, in which case it should either return 512 or 0, given that card.raw contains some number of 512-byte blocks. In order to read every block from card.raw, after opening it with fopen, it should suffice to use a loop like this.\n#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    // Accept a single command-line argument\n    if (argc != 2)\n    {\n        printf(\"Usage: ./recover FILE\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Open the memory card\n    FILE *card = fopen(argv[1], \"r\");\n\n    // Create a buffer for a block of data\n    uint8_t buffer[512];\n\n    // While there's still data left to read from the memory card\n    while (fread(buffer, 1, 512, card) == 512)\n    {\n        // Create JPEGs from the data\n\n    }\n}\nThat way, as soon as fread returns 0 (which is effectively false), your loop will end.\nFinally, it’s up to you to determine how to programmatically create JPEGs as you continue to read from card.raw. For this, you might find the below walkthrough of use to you.\nKeep in mind your program should number the files it outputs by naming each ###.jpg, where ### is three-digit decimal number from 000 on up. Befriend sprintf and note that sprintf stores a formatted string at a location in memory. Given the prescribed ###.jpg format for a JPEG’s filename, how many bytes should you allocate for that string? (Don’t forget the NUL character!)\nTo check whether the JPEGs your program spit out are correct, simply double-click and take a look! If each photo appears intact, your operation was likely a success!\nAnd of course, remember to fclose every file you’ve opened with fopen!\nKeep your working directory clean\nOdds are the JPEGs that the first draft of your code spits out won’t be correct. (If you open them up and don’t see anything, they’re probably not correct!) Execute the command below to delete all JPEGs in your current working directory.\nrm *.jpg\nIf you’d rather not be prompted to confirm each deletion, execute the command below instead.\nrm -f *.jpg\nJust be careful with that -f switch, as it “forces” deletion without prompting you.\n\nHow to Submit\n\nClick and accept the Homework Link on the homework main page for this week.\nComplete each assignment for this week in the Github Codespaces environment.\nSave and click “Commit changes”.\nThe autograder runs automatically; see the Actions tab for feedback."

    "text": "Advice\nGiven the many files in this program, it’s important to read this section in its entirety before starting. You’ll then know what to do and how to do it!\nTheoretically, on input of size n, an algorithm with a running time of n is “asymptotically equivalent,” in terms of O, to an algorithm with a running time of 2n. Indeed, when describing the running time of an algorithm, we typically focus on the dominant (i.e., most impactful) term (i.e., n in this case, since n could be much larger than 2). In the real world, though, the fact of the matter is that 2n feels twice as slow as n.\nThe challenge ahead of you is to implement the fastest spell checker you can! By “fastest,” though, we’re talking actual “wall-clock,” not asymptotic, time.\nIn speller.c, we’ve put together a program that’s designed to spell-check a file after loading a dictionary of words from disk into memory. That dictionary, meanwhile, is implemented in a file called dictionary.c. (It could just be implemented in speller.c, but as programs get more complex, it’s often convenient to break them into multiple files.) The prototypes for the functions therein, meanwhile, are defined not in dictionary.c itself but in dictionary.h instead. That way, both speller.c and dictionary.c can #include the file. Unfortunately, we didn’t quite get around to implementing the loading part. Or the checking part. Both (and a bit more) we leave to you! But first, a tour.\ndictionary.h\nOpen up dictionary.h, and you’ll see some new syntax, including a few lines that mention DICTIONARY_H. No need to worry about those, but, if curious, those lines just ensure that, even though dictionary.c and speller.c (which you’ll see in a moment) #include this file, clang will only compile it once.\nNext notice how we #include a file called stdbool.h. That’s the file in which bool itself is defined. You’ve not needed it before, since the CS50 Library used to #include that for you.\nAlso notice our use of #define, a “preprocessor directive” that defines a “constant” called LENGTH that has a value of 45. It’s a constant in the sense that you can’t (accidentally) change it in your own code. In fact, clang will replace any mentions of LENGTH in your own code with, literally, 45. In other words, it’s not a variable, just a find-and-replace trick.\nFinally, notice the prototypes for five functions: check, hash, load, size, and unload. Notice how three of those take a pointer as an argument, per the *:\nbool check(const char *word);\nunsigned int hash(const char *word);\nbool load(const char *dictionary);\nRecall that char * is what we used to call string. So those three prototypes are essentially just:\nbool check(const string word);\nunsigned int hash(const string word);\nbool load(const string dictionary);\nAnd const, meanwhile, just says that those strings, when passed in as arguments, must remain constant; you won’t be able to change them, accidentally or otherwise!\ndictionary.c\nNow open up dictionary.c. Notice how, atop the file, we’ve defined a struct called node that represents a node in a hash table. And we’ve declared a global pointer array, table, which will (soon) represent the hash table you will use to keep track of words in the dictionary. The array contains N node pointers, and we’ve set N equal to 26 for now, to match with the default hash function as described below. You will likely want to increase this depending on your own implementation of hash.\nNext, notice that we’ve implemented load, check, size, and unload, but only barely, just enough for the code to compile. Notice too that we’ve implemented hash with a sample algorithm based on the first letter of the word. Your job, ultimately, is to re-implement those functions as cleverly as possible so that this spell checker works as advertised. And fast!\nspeller.c\nOkay, next open up speller.c and spend some time looking over the code and comments therein. You won’t need to change anything in this file, and you don’t need to understand its entirety, but do try to get a sense of its functionality nonetheless. Notice how, by way of a function called getrusage, we’ll be “benchmarking” (i.e., timing the execution of) your implementations of check, load, size, and unload. Also notice how we go about passing check, word by word, the contents of some file to be spell-checked. Ultimately, we report each misspelling in that file along with a bunch of statistics.\nNotice, incidentally, that we have defined the usage of speller to be\nUsage: ./speller [dictionary] text\nwhere dictionary is assumed to be a file containing a list of lowercase words, one per line, and text is a file to be spell-checked. As the brackets suggest, provision of dictionary is optional; if this argument is omitted, speller will use dictionaries/large by default. In other words, running\n./speller text\nwill be equivalent to running\n./speller dictionaries/large text\nwhere text is the file you wish to spell-check. Suffice it to say, the former is easier to type! (Of course, speller will not be able to load any dictionaries until you implement load in dictionary.c! Until then, you’ll see Could not load.)\nWithin the default dictionary, mind you, are 143,091 words, all of which must be loaded into memory! In fact, take a peek at that file to get a sense of its structure and size. Notice that every word in that file appears in lowercase (even, for simplicity, proper nouns and acronyms). From top to bottom, the file is sorted lexicographically, with only one word per line (each of which ends with \\n). No word is longer than 45 characters, and no word appears more than once. During development, you may find it helpful to provide speller with a dictionary of your own that contains far fewer words, lest you struggle to debug an otherwise enormous structure in memory. In dictionaries/small is one such dictionary. To use it, execute\n./speller dictionaries/small text\nwhere text is the file you wish to spell-check. Don’t move on until you’re sure you understand how speller itself works!\nOdds are, you didn’t spend enough time looking over speller.c. Go back one square and walk yourself through it again!\ntexts/\nSo that you can test your implementation of speller, we’ve also provided you with a whole bunch of texts, among them the script from La La Land, the text of the Affordable Care Act, three million bytes from Tolstoy, some excerpts from The Federalist Papers and Shakespeare, and more. So that you know what to expect, open and skim each of those files, all of which are in a directory called texts within your pset5 directory.\nNow, as you should know from having read over speller.c carefully, the output of speller, if executed with, say,\n./speller texts/lalaland.txt\nwill eventually resemble the below.\nBelow’s some of the output you’ll see. For information’s sake, we’ve excerpted some examples of “misspellings.” And lest we spoil the fun, we’ve omitted our own statistics for now.\nMISSPELLED WORDS\n\n[...]\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT\n[...]\nShangri\n[...]\nfianc\n[...]\nSebastian's\n[...]\n\nWORDS MISSPELLED:\nWORDS IN DICTIONARY:\nWORDS IN TEXT:\nTIME IN load:\nTIME IN check:\nTIME IN size:\nTIME IN unload:\nTIME IN TOTAL:\nTIME IN load represents the number of seconds that speller spends executing your implementation of load. TIME IN check represents the number of seconds that speller spends, in total, executing your implementation of check. TIME IN size represents the number of seconds that speller spends executing your implementation of size. TIME IN unload represents the number of seconds that speller spends executing your implementation of unload. TIME IN TOTAL is the sum of those four measurements.\nNote that these times may vary somewhat across executions of speller, depending on what else your codespace is doing, even if you don’t change your code.\nIncidentally, to be clear, by “misspelled” we simply mean that some word is not in the dictionary provided.\nMakefile\nAnd, lastly, recall that make automates compilation of your code so that you don’t have to execute clang manually along with a whole bunch of switches. However, as your programs grow in size, make won’t be able to infer from context anymore how to compile your code; you’ll need to start telling make how to compile your program, particularly when they involve multiple source (i.e., .c) files, as in the case of this problem. And so we’ll utilize a Makefile, a configuration file that tells make exactly what to do. Open up Makefile, and you should see four lines:\n\nThe first line tells make to execute the subsequent lines whenever you yourself execute make speller (or just make).\nThe second line tells make how to compile speller.c into machine code (i.e., speller.o).\nThe third line tells make how to compile dictionary.c into machine code (i.e., dictionary.o).\nThe fourth line tells make to link speller.o and dictionary.o in a file called speller.\n\nBe sure to compile speller by executing make speller (or just make). Executing make dictionary won’t work!"

    "text": "Specification\nAlright, the challenge now before you is to implement, in order, load, hash, size, check, and unload as efficiently as possible using a hash table in such a way that TIME IN load, TIME IN check, TIME IN size, and TIME IN unload are all minimized. To be sure, it’s not obvious what it even means to be minimized, inasmuch as these benchmarks will certainly vary as you feed speller different values for dictionary and for text. But therein lies the challenge, if not the fun, of this problem. This problem is your chance to design. Although we invite you to minimize space, your ultimate enemy is time. But before you dive in, some specifications from us.\n\nYou may not alter speller.c or Makefile.\nYou may alter dictionary.c (and, in fact, must in order to complete the implementations of load, hash, size, check, and unload), but you may not alter the declarations (i.e., prototypes) of load, hash, size, check, or unload. You may, though, add new functions and (local or global) variables to dictionary.c.\nYou may change the value of N in dictionary.c, so that your hash table can have more buckets.\nYou may alter dictionary.h, but you may not alter the declarations of load, hash, size, check, or unload.\nYour implementation of check must be case-insensitive. In other words, if foo is in dictionary, then check should return true given any capitalization thereof; none of foo, foO, fOo, fOO, fOO, Foo, FoO, FOo, and FOO should be considered misspelled.\nCapitalization aside, your implementation of check should only return true for words actually in dictionary. Beware hard-coding common words (e.g., the), lest we pass your implementation a dictionary without those same words. Moreover, the only possessives allowed are those actually in dictionary. In other words, even if foo is in dictionary, check should return false given foo's if foo's is not also in dictionary.\nYou may assume that any dictionary passed to your program will be structured exactly like ours, alphabetically sorted from top to bottom with one word per line, each of which ends with \\n. You may also assume that dictionary will contain at least one word, that no word will be longer than LENGTH (a constant defined in dictionary.h) characters, that no word will appear more than once, that each word will contain only lowercase alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes, and that no word will start with an apostrophe.\nYou may assume that check will only be passed words that contain (uppercase or lowercase) alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes.\nYour spell checker may only take text and, optionally, dictionary as input. Although you might be inclined (particularly if among those more comfortable) to “pre-process” our default dictionary in order to derive an “ideal hash function” for it, you may not save the output of any such pre-processing to disk in order to load it back into memory on subsequent runs of your spell checker in order to gain an advantage.\nYour spell checker must not leak any memory. Be sure to check for leaks with valgrind.\nThe hash function you write should ultimately be your own, not one you search for online.\n\nAlright, ready to go?\n\nImplement load.\nImplement hash.\nImplement size.\nImplement check.\nImplement unload."

    "section": "Hints",
    "text": "Hints\nClick the below toggles to read some advice!\nImplement load\nComplete the load function. load should load the dictionary into memory (in particular, into a hash table!). load should return true if successful and false otherwise.\nConsider that this problem is just composed of smaller problems:\n\nOpen the dictionary file\nRead each word in the file\n\nAdd each word to the hash table\n\nClose the dictionary file\n\nWrite some pseudocode to remind yourself to do just that:\nbool load(const char *dictionary)\n{\n    // Open the dictionary file\n\n    // Read each word in the file\n\n        // Add each word to the hash table\n\n    // Close the dictionary file\n}\nConsider first how to open the dictionary file. fopen is a natural choice. You can use mode r, given that you need only read words from the dictionary file (not write or append them).\nbool load(const char *dictionary)\n{\n    // Open the dictionary file\n    FILE *source = fopen(dictionary, \"r\");\n\n    // Read each word in the file\n\n        // Add each word to the hash table\n\n    // Close the dictionary file\n}\nBefore moving on, you should write code to check whether the file opened correctly. That’s up to you! It’s also best to ensure you close every file you open, so now’s a good time to write the code to close the dictionary file:\nbool load(const char *dictionary)\n{\n    // Open the dictionary file\n    FILE *source = fopen(dictionary, \"r\");\n\n    // Read each word in the file\n\n        // Add each word to the hash table\n\n    // Close the dictionary file\n    fclose(source);\n}\nWhat remains is to read each word in the file and to add each word to the hash table. Return true when the entire operation is successful and false if it ever fails. Consider following this problem’s walkthrough and continue to break sub-problems into even smaller problems. For example, adding each word to the hash table might only be a matter of implementing a few, even smaller, steps:\n\nCreate space for a new hash table node\nCopy the word into the new node\nHash the word to obtain its hash value\nInsert the new node into the hash table (using the index specified by its hash value)\n\nOf course, there’s more one way to approach this problem, each with their own design trade-offs. For that reason, the rest of the code is up to you!\nImplement hash\nComplete the hash function. hash should take a string, word, as input and return a positive (“unsigned”) int.\nThe hash function given to you returns an int between 0 and 25, inclusive, based on the first character of word. However, there are many ways to implement a hash function beyond using the first character (or characters) of a word. Consider a hash function that uses a sum of ASCII values or the length of a word. A good hash function reduces “collisions” and has a (mostly!) even distribution across hash table “buckets”.\nImplement size\nComplete the size function. size should return the number of words loaded in the dictionary. Consider two approaches to this problem:\n\nCount each word as you load it into the dictionary. Return that count when size is called.\nEach time size is called, iterate through the words in the hash table to count them up. Return that count.\n\nWhich seems most efficient to you? Whichever you choose, we’ll leave the code up to you.\nImplement check\nComplete the check function. check should return true if a word is located in the dictionary, otherwise false.\nConsider that this problem is also composed of smaller problems. If you’ve implemented a hash table, finding a word takes only a few steps:\n\nHash the word to obtain its hash value\nSearch the hash table at the location specified by the word’s hash value\n\nReturn true if the word is found\n\nReturn false if no word is found\n\nTo compare two strings case-insensitively, you may find strcasecmp (declared in strings.h) useful! You’ll likely also want to ensure that your hash function is case-insensitive, such that foo and FOO have the same hash value.\nImplement unload\nComplete the unload function. Be sure to free in unload any memory that you allocated in load!\nRecall that valgrind is your newest best friend. Know that valgrind watches for leaks while your program is actually running, so be sure to provide command-line arguments if you want valgrind to analyze speller while you use a particular dictionary and/or text, as in the below. Best to use a small text, though, else valgrind could take quite a while to run.\nvalgrind ./speller texts/cat.txt\nIf you run valgrind without specifying a text for speller, your implementations of load and unload won’t actually get called (and thus analyzed).\nIf unsure how to interpret the output of valgrind, do just ask help50 for help:\nhelp50 valgrind ./speller texts/cat.txt"

Well, you’re welcome to consult the “answer keys” that are inside of the keys directory that’s inside of your speller directory. For instance, inside of keys/lalaland.txt are all of the words that your program should think are misspelled.\nYou could therefore run your program on some text in one window, as with the below.\n./speller texts/lalaland.txt\nAnd you could then run the staff’s solution on the same text in another window, as with the below.\n./speller50 texts/lalaland.txt\nAnd you could then compare the windows visually side by side. That could get tedious quickly, though. So you might instead want to “redirect” your program’s output to a file, as with the below.\n./speller texts/lalaland.txt &gt; student.txt\n./speller50 texts/lalaland.txt &gt; staff.txt\nYou can then compare both files side by side in the same window with a program like diff, as with the below.\ndiff -y student.txt staff.txt\nAlternatively, to save time, you could just compare your program’s output (assuming you redirected it to, e.g., student.txt) against one of the answer keys without running the staff’s solution, as with the below.\ndiff -y student.txt keys/lalaland.txt\nIf your program’s output matches the staff’s, diff will output two columns that should be identical except for, perhaps, the running times at the bottom. If the columns differ, though, you’ll see a &gt; or | where they differ.

Be careful not to assume that if your solution runs successfully with the large dictionary it will also run successfully with the small one.

    "section": "Advice",
    "text": "Advice\nDNA is really just a sequence of molecules called nucleotides, arranged into a particular shape (a double helix). Every human cell has billions of nucleotides arranged in sequence. Each nucleotide of DNA contains one of four different bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T). Some portions of this sequence (i.e., genome) are the same, or at least very similar, across almost all humans, but other portions of the sequence have a higher genetic diversity and thus vary more across the population.\nOne place where DNA tends to have high genetic diversity is in Short Tandem Repeats (STRs). An STR is a short sequence of DNA bases that tends to repeat consecutively numerous times at specific locations inside of a person’s DNA. The number of times any particular STR repeats varies a lot among individuals. In the DNA samples below, for example, Alice has the STR AGAT repeated four times in her DNA, while Bob has the same STR repeated five times.\n\n\n\nSample STRs\n\n\nUsing multiple STRs, rather than just one, can improve the accuracy of DNA profiling. If the probability that two people have the same number of repeats for a single STR is 5%, and the analyst looks at 10 different STRs, then the probability that two DNA samples match purely by chance is about 1 in 1 quadrillion (assuming all STRs are independent of each other). So if two DNA samples match in the number of repeats for each of the STRs, the analyst can be pretty confident they came from the same person. CODIS, the FBI’s DNA database, uses 20 different STRs as part of its DNA profiling process.\nWhat might such a DNA database look like? Well, in its simplest form, you could imagine formatting a DNA database as a CSV file, wherein each row corresponds to an individual, and each column corresponds to a particular STR.\nname,AGAT,AATG,TATC\nAlice,28,42,14\nBob,17,22,19\nCharlie,36,18,25\nThe data in the above file would suggest that Alice has the sequence AGAT repeated 28 times consecutively somewhere in her DNA, the sequence AATG repeated 42 times, and TATC repeated 14 times. Bob, meanwhile, has those same three STRs repeated 17 times, 22 times, and 19 times, respectively. And Charlie has those same three STRs repeated 36, 18, and 25 times, respectively.\nSo given a sequence of DNA, how might you identify to whom it belongs? Well, imagine that you looked through the DNA sequence for the longest consecutive sequence of repeated AGATs and found that the longest sequence was 17 repeats long. If you then found that the longest sequence of AATG is 22 repeats long, and the longest sequence of TATC is 19 repeats long, that would provide pretty good evidence that the DNA was Bob’s. Of course, it’s also possible that once you take the counts for each of the STRs, it doesn’t match anyone in your DNA database, in which case you have no match.\nIn practice, since analysts know on which chromosome and at which location in the DNA an STR will be found, they can localize their search to just a narrow section of DNA. But we’ll ignore that detail for this problem.\nYour task is to write a program that will take a sequence of DNA and a CSV file containing STR counts for a list of individuals and then output to whom the DNA (most likely) belongs.\nSpecification\n\nThe program should require as its first command-line argument the name of a CSV file containing the STR counts for a list of individuals and should require as its second command-line argument the name of a text file containing the DNA sequence to identify.\n\nIf your program is executed with the incorrect number of command-line arguments, your program should print an error message of your choice (with print). If the correct number of arguments are provided, you may assume that the first argument is indeed the filename of a valid CSV file and that the second argument is the filename of a valid text file.\n\nYour program should open the CSV file and read its contents into memory.\n\nYou may assume that the first row of the CSV file will be the column names. The first column will be the word name and the remaining columns will be the STR sequences themselves.\n\nYour program should open the DNA sequence and read its contents into memory.\nFor each of the STRs (from the first line of the CSV file), your program should compute the longest run of consecutive repeats of the STR in the DNA sequence to identify. Notice that we’ve defined a helper function for you, longest_match, which will do just that!\nIf the STR counts match exactly with any of the individuals in the CSV file, your program should print out the name of the matching individual.\n\nYou may assume that the STR counts will not match more than one individual.\nIf the STR counts do not match exactly with any of the individuals in the CSV file, your program should print No match.\n\n\nHints\n\nYou may find Python’s csv module helpful for reading CSV files into memory. Of particular help might be csv.DictReader.\n\nFor instance, if a file like foo.csv has a header row, wherein each string is the name of some field, here’s how you might print those fieldnames as a list:\nimport csv\n\nwith open(\"foo.csv\") as file:\n    reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n    print(reader.fieldnames)\nAnd here’s how you read all of the (other) rows from a CSV into a list, wherein each element is a dict that represents that row:\nimport csv\n\nrows = []\nwith open(\"foo.csv\") as file:\n    reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n    for row in reader:\n        rows.append(row)\n\nThe open and read functions might also prove useful for reading text files into memory.\nConsider what data structures might be helpful for keeping tracking of information in your program. A list or a dict may prove useful.\nRemember we’ve defined a function (longest_match) that, given both a DNA sequence and an STR as inputs, returns the maximum number of times that the STR repeats. You can then use that function in other parts of your program!\n\nHow to Test\nYou’re encouraged to test your code on your own for each of the following.\n\nRun your program as python dna.py databases/small.csv sequences/1.txt.

You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute\nrm songs.zip\nand respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP file you downloaded.\nNow type\ncd songs\nfollowed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.\nsongs/ $\nIf all was successful, you should execute\nls\nand you should see 8 .sql files, songs.db, and answers.txt.\nIf you run into any trouble, follow these same steps again and see if you can determine where you went wrong!\nUnderstanding\nProvided to you is a file called songs.db, a SQLite database that stores data from Spotify about songs and their artists. This dataset contains the top 100 streamed songs on Spotify in 2018. In a terminal window, run sqlite3 songs.db so that you can begin executing queries on the database.\nFirst, when sqlite3 prompts you to provide a query, type .schema and press enter. This will output the CREATE TABLE statements that were used to generate each of the tables in the database. By examining those statements, you can identify the columns present in each table.\nNotice that every artist has an id and a name. Notice, too, that every song has a name, an artist_id (corresponding to the id of the artist of the song), as well as values for the danceability, energy, key, loudness, speechiness (presence of spoken words in a track), valence, tempo, and duration of the song (measured in milliseconds).\nThe challenge ahead of you is to write SQL queries to answer a variety of different questions by selecting data from one or more of these tables. After you do so, you’ll reflect on the ways Spotify might use this same data in their annual Spotify Wrapped campaign to characterize listeners’ habits.\nImplementation\nFor each of the following problems, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query, though you may nest other queries inside of your query. You should not assume anything about the ids of any particular songs or artists: your queries should be accurate even if the id of any particular song or person were different. Finally, each query should return only the data necessary to answer the question: if the problem only asks you to output the names of songs, for example, then your query should not also output each song’s tempo.\n\nIn 1.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in the database.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.\n\nIn 2.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in increasing order of tempo.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.\n\nIn 3.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of the top 5 longest songs, in descending order of length.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.\n\nIn 4.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of any songs that have danceability, energy, and valence greater than 0.75.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.\n\nIn 5.sql, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of all the songs.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column and a single row containing the average energy.\n\nIn 6.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of songs that are by Post Malone.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.\nYou should not make any assumptions about what Post Malone’s artist_id is.\n\nIn 7.sql, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of songs that are by Drake.\n\nYour query should output a table with a single column and a single row containing the average energy.\nYou should not make any assumptions about what Drake’s artist_id is.\n\nIn 8.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of the songs that feature other artists.\n\nSongs that feature other artists will include “feat.” in the name of the song.\nYour query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.\n\n\nHints\nSee this SQL keywords reference for some SQL syntax that may be helpful!\nList the names of all songs in the database\nRecall that, to select all values in a table’s column, you can use SQL’s SELECT keyword. SELECT is followed by the column (or columns) you’d like to select, which is in turn followed by FROM table where table is the name of the table you’d like to select from.\nIn 1.sql, then, try writing the following:\n-- All songs in the database.\nSELECT name\nFROM songs;\nList the names of all songs in increasing order of tempo\nRecall that SQL has an ORDER BY keyword, by which you can order the results of your query by the value in a certain column. For example, ORDER BY tempo will order results by the column tempo.\nIn 2.sql, then, try writing the following:\n-- All songs in increasing order of tempo.\nSELECT name\nFROM songs\nORDER BY tempo;\nList the names of the top 5 longest songs, in descending order of length\nRecall that ORDER BY need not always sort in ascending order. You can specify that your results be sorted in descending order by appending DESC. For example, ORDER BY duration_ms DESC will list results in descending order, by duration.\nAnd recall, too, that LIMIT n can specify that you only want the first (n) rows that match a specific query. For example, LIMIT 5 will return only the first five results of the query.\nIn 3.sql, then, try writing the following:\n-- The names of the top 5 longest songs, in descending order of length.\nSELECT name\nFROM songs\nORDER BY duration_ms DESC\nLIMIT 5;\nList the names of any songs that have danceability, energy, and valence greater than 0.75\nRecall that you can filter results in SQL with WHERE clauses, which are followed by some condition which typically tests the values in a row’s columns.\nRecall, too, that SQL’s operators function much the same way as C’s. For example, &gt; evaluates to “true” when the value on the left is greater than the value on the right. You may chain these expressions together, using AND or OR, to form one larger condition.\nIn 4.sql, then, try writing the following:\n-- The names of any songs that have danceability, energy, and valence greater than 0.75.\nSELECT name\nFROM songs\nWHERE danceability &gt; 0.75 AND energy &gt; 0.75 AND valence &gt; 0.75;\nFind average energy of all the songs\nRecall that SQL supports keywords not just to select particular rows, but also to aggregate the data in those rows. In particular, you might find the AVG keyword (to compute averages) useful. To aggregate the results of a column, just apply the aggregation function to that column. For example, SELECT AVG(energy) will find the average of the values in the energy column for the given query.\nIn 5.sql, then, try writing the following:\n-- The average energy of all the songs.\nSELECT AVG(energy)\nFROM songs;\nList the names of songs that are by Post Malone\nNotice that, if you execute .schema songs in your sqlite prompt, the songs table has song names but not artist names! Instead, songs has an artist_id column. To list the names of songs by Post Malone, then, you’ll first need to identify Post Malone’s artist id.\n-- Identify Post Malone's artist id\nSELECT id\nFROM artists\nWHERE name = 'Post Malone';\nThis query returns 54. Now, you could query the songs table for any song with Post Malone’s id.\nSELECT name\nFROM songs\nWHERE artist_id = 54;\nBut, per the specification, you should be mindful not to assume knowledge of any ids. You could improve the design of this query by nesting your two queries.\nIn 6.sql, then, try writing the following:\n-- The names of songs that are by Post Malone.\nSELECT name\nFROM songs\nWHERE artist_id =\n(\n    SELECT id\n    FROM artists\n    WHERE name = 'Post Malone'\n);\nFind the average energy of songs that are by Drake\nNotice that, similar to the previous query, you’ll need to combine multiple tables to successfully run this query. You could again use nested subqueries, but consider another approach too!\nRecall that you can use SQL’s JOIN keyword to combine multiple tables into one, so long as you specify which columns across those tables should ultimately match. For example, the following query joins the songs and artists tables, indicating that the artist_id column in the songs table and the id column in the artists table should match:\nSELECT *\nFROM songs\nJOIN artists ON songs.artist_id = artists.id\nWith these two tables combined, it’s only a matter of filtering your selection to find the average energy of songs by Drake.\nIn 7.sql, then, try writing the following:\n-- The average energy of songs that are by Drake\nSELECT AVG(energy)\nFROM songs\nJOIN artists ON songs.artist_id = artists.id\nWHERE artists.name = 'Drake';\nList the names of the songs that feature other artists\nFor this query, note that songs which feature other artists typically have some mention of “feat.” in their title. Recall that SQL’s LIKE keyword can be used to match strings with certain phrases (like “feat.”!). To do so, you can use %: a wildcard character that matches any sequence of characters.\nIn 8.sql, then, try writing the following:\n-- The names of songs that feature other artists.\nSELECT name\nFROM songs\nWHERE name LIKE '%feat.%';\nSpotify Wrapped\nSpotify Wrapped is a feature presenting Spotify users’ 100 most played songs from the past year. In 2021, Spotify Wrapped calculated an “Audio Aura” for each user, a “reading of [their] two most prominent moods as dictated by [their] top songs and artists of the year.” Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year. In answers.txt, reflect on the following questions:\n\nIf songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?\nHypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?\n\nBe sure to submit answers.txt along with each of your .sql files!"

    "title": "FAQ",
    "section": "Why do I keep running out of GitHub Codespace time?",
    "text": "Why do I keep running out of GitHub Codespace time?\nThere are two types of Codespaces usage: compute and storage. Each month as you use Codespaces, your compute and storage usage is deducted from the quota of free usage that’s included in your personal GitHub account until either compute or storage is consumed.\nOnce one of those limits is reached, your use of GitHub Codespaces will be restricted. You will not be able to create new Codespaces or open existing Codespaces, until the monthly quota renews in the following month.\nStandard allowance is 15GB-hours of storage per month and 120 hours of compute time. If you sign up to GitHub Education, this increases to 20GB-hours and 180 hours of compute time. Highly recommend doing this - it can take 72 hours to be confirmed following application\n\nHow can I get the most out of my Codespace time?\nSome tips from GitHub for making allowed usage go further:\n\nYour codespaces consume compute usage while they are running. If you’re not using a codespace, stopping the codespace prevents unnecessary compute usage. See Stopping and starting a codespace.\nYou can reduce the idle timeout for Codespaces in your personal settings to less than the default 30 minutes. This will shorten the period of inactivity before your codespaces are automatically stopped. This can save on compute usage. See Setting your timeout period for GitHub Codespaces.\nYour codespaces consume storage while they exist. You should delete a codespace you have finished using and know that you will not use again. See Deleting a codespace.\nConfigure your retention period to ensure codespaces you forget to delete are deleted automatically. The default retention period is 30 days. See Configuring automatic deletion of your codespaces.\nVisual Studio Code extensions consume storage. Make sure you are only installing extensions that you need. You can find out how much space is being used by extensions by running this command in your codespace.\n\ndu -h -s ~/.vscode-remote/extensions\n\nMonitor your compute and storage usage by going to your billing page on GitHub, and reviewing the figures in the “Codespaces” section.",

But, you will still need to use our Github Codespaces to submit your work.\nHowever, installing and configuring programming and editing software on your own computer is sometimes complicated and irritating, even for very experienced people. Configuring all the tools we will be using in The Sandbox to be exactly the same on your own computer, operating system, etc., will require advanced skills. Still, you can do it if you want to; most of the tools are open source and free and will work for most tasks.

    "text": "Final Project\nThe capstone of this course is the final project. The final project is your opportunity to take your new programming skills and create your own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this module’s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you. You may implement your project in any language covered in the module. We ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact your community, or that you change the world. Strive to create something great that outlives this module.\nYou are allowed an opportunity to collaborate with one or two classmates for this final project. It is expected that every student in any such group contribute equally to the design and implementation of that project. Moreover, it is expected that the scope of a two- or three-person group’s project be, respectively, two or three times that of a typical one-person project.\nIdeas * a web-based application using Python, and SQL * an educational game using Scratch * a command-line program using C\n\n\nGetting Started\nCreating an entire project may seem daunting. Here are some questions that you should think about as you start:\nWhat will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed? What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one or two classmates, who will do what? In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it’s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome? Consider making goal milestones to keep you on track.\nYour project should be developed based on a Github repository. You should create a new repository for your project, and then add your project files to it. You should then add a README.md file to the repository, and a LICENSE file (if you want to use a license). You should then push your project to the repository. If in a group with more than one person, you should add the other members as collaborators to the repository. The project repository should be on the group leader’s account and the README should list the group membership including real name, Github name, and briefly detail contributions.\n\n\nHow to Submit\nYou must complete the steps below before the project deadline.\nStep 1 Create a short video (no more than 3 minutes in length) in which you present and “pitch” your project to the world.\nYour video must begin with an opening section that displays:\n\nyour project’s title\nyour names\nyour GitHub usernames\nyour home town and country\nand, the date you have recorded this video. It should then go on to demonstrate your project in action, as with slides, screenshots, voiceover, and/or live action. See howtogeek.com/205742/how-to-record-your-windows-mac-linux-android-or-ios-screen for tips on how to make a “screencast,” though you’re welcome to use an actual camera. Upload your video to YouTube (or, if blocked in your country, a similar site) and take note of its URL; it’s fine to flag it as “unlisted,” but don’t flag it as “private.”\n\nStep 2 Your README.md text file (named exactly that!) in your project repository must document and explain your project. This file should include your Project Title, the URL of your video (created in step 1 above) and a description of your project. You may use the below as a template.\n\n\nYOUR PROJECT TITLE\n## Group name:\n## Group members:\n* Name: GitHub username:S\n* Name: GitHub username:\n#### Video Demo:  &lt;URL HERE&gt;\n#### Description:\n#### TODO list and group member who worked on it:\nIf unfamiliar with Markdown syntax, you might find GitHub’s Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax helpful. You can also preview your .md file by clicking the ‘preview’ icon as explained here: Markdown Preview in vscode. Standard software project READMEs can often run into the thousands or tens of thousands of words in length; yours need not be that long, but should at least be several hundred words that describe things in detail!\nYour README.md file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should explain what your project is, what each of the files you wrote for the project contains and does, and if you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them. Ensure you allocate sufficient time and energy to writing a README.md that documents your project thoroughly. Be proud of it! A README.md in the neighborhood of 750 words is likely to be sufficient for describing your project and all aspects of its functionality. If unable to reach that threshold, that probably means your project is insufficiently complex.\nThe Github repository link for your project must be submitted via the Harper Adams Hub BY EACH GROUP MEMBER.",

This reverses traditional teaching by having students go through new material independently, through videos or readings, before class meetings. Then, class time is used for discussion, problem-solving, assessments, and applying ideas. This lets students work through content at their own pace and ensures that support from teachers and peers is available when tackling challenging concepts.

Each set will consist of practical tasks involving various programming challenges.\n\n\nAssessment 2\nProject: This is an opportunity to apply programming skills in developing your own software solution. This project encourages creativity and innovation, allowing you to choose an appropriate programming language and build an application that is personally meaningful, solves real-world problems, or potentially impacts the community or world at large.\nFor the project you can opt to work individually or collaborate with up to two other classmates, with the expectation that each member contributes equally to the project design and implementation. The complexity of the project should reflect the size of the group, with group projects expected to be more intricate than individual ones. The final project is assessed based on the project complexity and scope, the effectiveness of the implemented solution, creativity, and the overall quality of the code. For group projects, the assessment also considers individual contributions and the collaborative effort. NB for group projects, the scope and ambition of the project should reflect the size of the group.",

The module staff and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the course staff, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, let’s talk about it. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, share it and let’s discuss. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo some of the optional readings, read and share relevant Twitter/X posts, read and share relevant Hacker News articles. Consider joining or forming a reading group that meets once per week to discuss.\nDo the homework and the tutorials. The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, ask for help, and let us help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

First, the first if statement is evaluated. Then, the second if statement runs its evaluation. Finally, the last if statement runs its evaluation. This flow of decisions is called “control flow.”\nOur code can be represented as follows:\nflowchart TD\n  A([start]) --&gt; B{x &lt; y}\n  B -- True --&gt; C[\"#quot;x is less than y#quot;\"]\n  C --&gt; D{x &gt; y}\n  D -- True --&gt; E[\"#quot;x is greater than y#quot;\"]\n  E --&gt; F{x == y}\n  F -- True --&gt; G[\"#quot;x is equal to y#quot;\"]\n  G --&gt; H([stop])\n  B -- False --&gt; D\n  D -- False --&gt; F\n  F -- False --&gt; H\nThis program can be improved by not asking three consecutive questions. After all, not all three questions can have an outcome of true! Revise your program as follows:\nx = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\ny = int(input(\"What's y? \"))\n\nif x &lt; y:\n    print(\"x is less than y\")\nelif x &gt; y:\n    print(\"x is greater than y\")\nelif x == y:\n    print(\"x is equal to y\")\nNotice how the use of elif allows the program to make fewer decisions. First, the if statement is evaluated. If this statement is found to be true, all the elif statements will not be run at all. However, if the if statement is evaluated and found to be false, the first elif will be evaluated. If this is true, it will not run the final evaluation.\nOur code can be represented as follows:\nflowchart TD\n  A([start]) --&gt; B{x &lt; y}\n  B -- True --&gt; C[\"#quot;x is less than y#quot;\"]\n  B -- False --&gt; D{x &gt; y}\n  D -- True --&gt; E[\"#quot;x is greater than y#quot;\"]\n  D -- False --&gt; F{x == y}\n  F -- True --&gt; G[\"#quot;x is equal to y#quot;\"]\n  G --&gt; H([stop])\n  F -- False --&gt; H\n  C --&gt; H\n  E --&gt; H\nWhile your computer may not notice a difference speed-wise between our first program and this revised program, consider how an online server running billions or trillions of these types of calculations each day could definitely be impacted by such a small coding decision.\nThere is one final improvement we can make to our program. Notice how logically elif x == y is not a necessary evaluation to run. After all, if logically x is not less than y AND x is not greater than y, x MUST equal y. Therefore, we don’t have to run elif x == y. We can create a “catch-all,” default outcome using an else statement. We can revise as follows:\nx = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\ny = int(input(\"What's y? \"))\n\nif x &lt; y:\n    print(\"x is less than y\")\nelif x &gt; y:\n    print(\"x is greater than y\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is equal to y\")\nNotice how the relative complexity of this program has decreased through our revision.\nOur code can be represented as follows:\nflowchart TD\n  A([start]) --&gt; B{x &lt; y}\n  B -- True --&gt; C[\"#quot;x is less than y#quot;\"]\n  B -- False --&gt; D{x &gt; y}\n  D -- True --&gt; E[\"#quot;x is greater than y#quot;\"]\n  D -- False --&gt; F[\"#quot;x is equal to y#quot;\"]\n  F --&gt; G([stop])\n  C --&gt; G\n  E --&gt; G",

The efficiency of our code is increased.\nAt this point, our code is pretty great. However, could the design be further improved? We could further edit our code as follows:\nx = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\ny = int(input(\"What's y? \"))\n\nif x != y:\n    print(\"x is not equal to y\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is equal to y\")\nNotice how we removed the or entirely and simply asked, “Is x not equal to y?” We ask one and only one question.

However, notice how there is potential for bugs.\nTypically, we do not want to ever trust our users to input the correct information.

For example, perhaps you intended for a user to input a number, but they input a character instead. Your program may throw an error because of this unexpected input from the user.\nIn your terminal window, run code number.py. Code as follows in your text editor:\nx = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\nprint(f\"x is {x}\")\nNotice that by including the f, we tell Python to interpolate what is in the curly braces as the value of x. Further, testing out your code, you can imagine how one could easily type in a string or a character instead of a number. Even still, a user could type nothing at all – simply hitting the enter key.\nAs programmers, we should be defensive to ensure that our users are entering what we expected.\nIf we run this program and type “cat”, we’ll see ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'cat'. In other words, the int function cannot convert the text “cat” into a number.\nAn effective strategy to fix this potential error would be to create “error handling” to ensure the user behaves as we intend.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of Errors and Exceptions.",

However, typing in cat will produce an error visible to the user, instructing them why their input was not accepted.\nThis is still not the best way to implement this code.

Note that you may have previously coded this file in a previous lecture. In the text editor, make sure that your code appears as follows:\ndef main():\n    x = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\n    print(\"x squared is\", square(x))\n\n\ndef square(n):\n    return n * n\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice that you could plausibly test the above code on your own using some obvious numbers such as 2. However, consider why you might want to create a test that ensures that the above code functions appropriately.\nFollowing convention, let’s create a new test program by typing code test_calculator.py and modify your code in the text editor as follows:\nfrom calculator import square\n\n\ndef main():\n    test_square()\n\n\ndef test_square():\n    if square(2) != 4:\n        print(\"2 squared was not 4\")\n    if square(3) != 9:\n        print(\"3 squared was not 9\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice that we are importing the square function from calculator.py on the first line of code.\nIn the console window, type python test_calculator.py.

Essentially, this is the interpreter telling us that one of our conditions was not met.\nOne of the challenges that we are now facing is that our code could become even more burdensome if we wanted to provide more descriptive error output to our users. Plausibly, we could code as follows:\nfrom calculator import square\n\n\ndef main():\n    test_square()\n\n\ndef test_square():\n    try:\n        assert square(2) == 4\n    except AssertionError:\n        print(\"2 squared is not 4\")\n    try:\n        assert square(3) == 9\n    except AssertionError:\n        print(\"3 squared is not 9\")\n    try:\n        assert square(-2) == 4\n    except AssertionError:\n        print(\"-2 squared is not 4\")\n    try:\n        assert square(-3) == 9\n    except AssertionError:\n        print(\"-3 squared is not 9\")\n    try:\n        assert square(0) == 0\n    except AssertionError:\n        print(\"0 squared is not 0\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice that running this code will produce multiple errors. However, it’s not producing all the errors above. This is a good illustration that it’s worth testing multiple cases such that you might catch situations where there are coding mistakes.\nThe above code illustrates a major challenge: How could we make it easier to test your code without dozens of lines of code like the above?\n\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of assert.",

Testing frameworks like pytest will run each function, even if there was a failure in one of them. Re-running pytest test_calculator.py, you will notice that many more errors are being displayed. More error output allows you to further explore what might be producing the problems within your code.\nHaving improved our test code, return your calculator.py code to fully working order:\ndef main():\n    x = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\n    print(\"x squared is\", square(x))\n\n\ndef square(n):\n    return n * n\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice that we have changed the + operator to a * in the square function, returning it to a working state.\nRe-running pytest test_calculator.py, you will notice that no errors are found.\nFinally, we can test that our program handles exceptions.

We need to go to the top of our program and add import pytest and then call pytest.raises with the type of error we are expecting.\n\nAgain, re-running pytest test_calculator.py, you will notice that no errors are found.\nIn summary, it’s up to you as a coder to define as many test conditions as you see fit!\n\nYou can learn more in Pytest’s documentation of pytest.",

Modify your code as follows:\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif \"@\" in email and \".\" in email:\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice that while this works as expected, our user could be adversarial, typing simply @. would result in the program returning valid.\nWe can improve the logic of our program as follows:\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nusername, domain = email.split(\"@\")\n\nif username and \".\" in domain:\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice how the strip method is used to determine if username exists and if . is inside the domain variable. Running this program, a standard email address typed in by you could be considered valid. Typing in malan@harvard alone, you’ll find that the program regards this input as invalid.\nWe can be even more precise, modifying our code as follows:\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nusername, domain = email.split(\"@\")\n\nif username and domain.endswith(\".edu\"):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice how the endswith method will check to see if domain contains .edu. Still, however, a nefarious user could still break our code. For example, a user could type in malan@.edu and it would be considered valid.\nIndeed, we could keep iterating upon this code ourselves. However, it turns out that Python has an existing library called re that has a number of built-in functions that can validate user inputs against patterns.\nOne of the most versatile functions within the library re is search.\nThe search function follows the signature re.search(pattern, string, flags=0). Following this signature, we can modify our code as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(\"@\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice this does not increase the functionality of our program at all. In fact, it is somewhat a step back.\nWe can further our program’s functionality. However, we need to advance our vocabulary around validation. It turns out that in the world of regular expressions there are certain symbols that allow us to identify patterns. At this point, we have only been checking for specific pieces of text like @. It so happens that many special symbols can be passed to the interpreter for the purpose of engaging in validation. A non-exhaustive list of those patterns is as follows:\n.   any character except a new line\n*   0 or more repetitions\n+   1 or more repetitions\n?   0 or 1 repetition\n{m} m repetitions\n{m,n} m-n repetitions\nImplementing this inside of our code, modify yours as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(\".+@.+\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice that we don’t care what the username or domain is. What we care about is the pattern. .+ is used to determine if anything is to the left of the email address and if anything is to the right of the email address. Running your code, typing in malan@, you’ll notice that the input is regarded as invalid as we would hope.\nHad we used a regular expression .*@.* in our code above, you can visualize this as follows: \nNotice the depiction of the state machine of our regular expression. On the left, the interpreter begins evaluating the statement from left to right. Once we reach q1 or question 1, the interpreter reads time and time again based on the expression handed to it. Then, the state is changed looking now at q2 or the second question being validated. Again, the arrow indicates how the expression will be evaluated time and time again based upon our programming. Then, as depicted by the double circle, the final state of state machine is reached.\nConsidering the regular expression we used in our code, .+@.+, you can visualize it as follows: \nNotice how q1 is any character provided by the user, including ‘q2’ as 1 or more repetitions of characters. This is followed by the ‘@’ symbol. Then, q3 looks for any character provided by the user, including q4 as 1 or more repetitions of characters.\nThe re and re.search functions and ones like them look for patterns.\nContinuing our improvement of this code, we could improve our code as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(\".+@.+.edu\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice, however, that one could type in malan@harvard?edu and it could be considered valid. Why is this the case? You might recognize that in the language of validation, a . means any character!\nWe can modify our code as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\".+@.+\\.edu\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice how we utilize the “escape character” or \\ as a way of regarding the . as part of our string instead of our validation expression. Testing your code, you will notice that malan@harvard.edu is regarded as valid, where malan@harvard?edu is invalid.\nNow that we’re using escape characters, it’s a good time to introduce “raw strings”. In Python, raw strings are strings that don’t format special characters—instead, each character is taken at face-value. Imagine \\n, for example. We’ve seen in an earlier lecture how, in a regular string, these two characters become one: a special newline character. In a raw string, however, \\n is treated not as \\n, the special character, but as a single \\ and a single n. Placing an r in front of a string tells the Python interpreter to treat the string as a raw string, similar to how placing an f in front of a string tells the Python interpreter to treat the string as a format string:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^.+@.+\\.edu$\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNow we’ve ensured the Python interpreter won’t treat \\. as a special character. Instead, simply as a \\ followed by a .—which, in regular expression terms, means matching a literal “.”.\nYou can imagine still how our users could create problems for us! For example, you could type in a sentence such as My email address is malan@harvard.edu. and this whole sentence would be considered valid. We can be even more precise in our coding.\nIt just so happens we have more special symbols at our disposal in validation:\n^   matches the start of the string\n$   matches the end of the string or just before the newline at the end of the string\nWe can modify our code using our added vocabulary as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^.+@.+\\.edu$\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice this has the effect of looking for this exact pattern matching to the start and end of the expression being validated. Typing in a sentence such as My email address is malan@harvard.edu. now is regarded as invalid.\nWe propose we can do even better! Even though we are now looking for the username at the start of the string, the @ symbol, and the domain name at the end, we could type in as many @ symbols as we wish! malan@@@harvard.edu is considered valid!\nWe can add to our vocabulary as follows:\n[]    set of characters\n[^]   complementing the set\nUsing these newfound abilities, we can modify our expression as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^[^@]+@[^@]+\\.edu$\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice that ^ means to match at the start of the string. All the way at the end of our expression, $ means to match at the end of the string. [^@]+ means any character except an @. Then, we have a literal @. [^@]+\\.edu means any character except an @ followed by an expression ending in .edu. Typing in malan@@@harvard.edu is now regarded as invalid.\nWe can still improve this regular expression further. It turns out there are certain requirements for what an email address can be! Currently, our validation expression is far too accommodating. We might only want to allow for characters normally used in a sentence. We can modify our code as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+@[a-zA-Z0-9_]+\\.edu$\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice that [a-zA-Z0-9_] tells the validation that characters must be between a and z, between A and Z, between 0 and 9 and potentially include an _ symbol. Testing the input, you’ll find that many potential user mistakes can be indicated.\nThankfully, common patterns have been built into regular expressions by hard-working programmers. In this case, you can modify your code as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^\\w+@\\w+\\.edu$\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice that \\w is the same as [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Thanks, hard-working programmers!\nHere are some additional patterns we can add to our vocabulary:\n\\d    decimal digit\n\\D    not a decimal digit\n\\s    whitespace characters\n\\S    not a whitespace character\n\\w    word character, as well as numbers and the underscore\n\\W    not a word character\nNow, we know that there are not simply .edu email addresses. We could modify our code as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^\\w+@\\w.+\\.(com|edu|gov|net|org)$\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice that the | has the impact of an or in our expression.\nAdding even more symbols to our vocabulary, here are some more to consider:\nA|B     either A or B\n(...)   a group\n(?:...) non-capturing version",

    "text": "Case Sensitivity\n\nTo illustrate how you might address issues around case sensitivity, where there is a difference between EDU and edu and the like, let’s rewind our code to the following:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^\\w+@\\w+\\.edu$\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice how we have removed the | statements provided previously.\nRecall that within the re.search function, there is a parameter for flags.\nSome built-in flag variables are:\nre.IGNORECASE\nre.MULTILINE\nre.DOTALL\nConsider how you might use these in your code.\nTherefore, we can change our code as follows.\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^\\w+@\\w+\\.edu$\", email, re.IGNORECASE):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice how we added a third parameter re.IGNORECASE. Running this program with MALAN@HARVARD.EDU, the input is now considered valid.\nConsider the following email address malan@cs50.harvard.edu. Using our code above, this would be considered invalid. Why might that be?\nSince there is an additional ., the program considers this invalid.\nIt turns out that we can, looking at our vocabulary from before, we can group together ideas.\nA|B     either A or B\n(...)   a group\n(?:...) non-capturing version\nWe can modify our code as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^\\w+@(\\w+\\.)?\\w+\\.edu$\", email, re.IGNORECASE):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice how the (\\w+\\.)? communicates to the interpreter that this new expression can be there once or not at all. Hence, both malan@cs50.harvard.edu and malan@harvard.edu are considered valid.\nInterestingly enough, the edits we have done so far to our code do not fully encompass all the checking that could be done to ensure a valid email address. Indeed, here is the full expression that one would have to type to ensure that a valid email is inputted:\n^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+\\/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$\nThere are other functions within the re library you might find useful. re.match and re.fullmatch are ones you might find exceedingly useful.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of re.",

    "section": "Cleaning Up User Input",
    "text": "Cleaning Up User Input\n\nYou should never expect your users to always follow your hopes for clean input. Indeed, users will often violate your intentions as a programmer.\nThere are ways to clean up your data.\nIn the terminal window, type code format.py. Then, in the text-editor, code as follows:\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip()\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nNotice that we have created, essentially, a “hello world” program. Running this program and typing in David, it works well! However, typing in Malan, David notice how the program does not function as intended. How could we modify our program to clean up this input?\nModify your code as follows.\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip()\nif \",\" in name:\n    last, first = name.split(\", \")\n    name = f\"{first} {last}\"\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nNotice how last, first = name.split(\", \") is run if there is a , in the name. Then, the name is standardized as first and last. Running our code, typing in Malan, David, you can see how this program does clean up at least one scenario where a user types in something unexpected.\nYou might notice that typing in Malan,David with no space causes the interpreter to throw an error. Since we now know some regular expression syntax, let’s apply that to our code:\nimport re\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip()\nmatches = re.search(r\"^(.+), (.+)$\", name)\nif matches:\n    last, first = matches.groups()\n    name = first + \" \" + last\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nNotice that re.search can return a set of matches that are extracted from the user’s input. If matches are returned by re.search. Running this program, typing in David Malan notice how the if condition is not run and the name is returned. If you run the program by typing Malan, David, the name is also returned properly.\nIt just so happens that we can request specific groups back using matches.group. We can modify our code as follows:\nimport re\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip()\nmatches = re.search(r\"^(.+), (.+)$\", name)\nif matches:\n    name = matches.group(2) + \" \" + matches.group(1)\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nNotice how, in this implementation, group is not plural (there is no s).\nOur code can be further tightened as follows:\nimport re\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip()\nmatches = re.search(r\"^(.+), (.+)$\", name)\nif matches:\n    name = matches.group(2) + \" \" + matches.group(1)\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nNotice how group(2) and group(1) are concatenated together with a space. The first group is that which is left of the comma. The second group is that which is right of the comma.\nRecognize still that typing in Malan,David with no space will still break our code. Therefore, we can make the following modification:\nimport re\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip()\nmatches = re.search(r\"^(.+), *(.+)$\", name)\nif matches:\n    name = matches.group(2) + \" \" + matches.group(1)\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nNotice the addition of the * in our validation statement. This code will now accept and properly process Malan,David. Further, it will properly handle David,Malanwith many spaces in front ofDavid.\nIt is very common to utilize re.search as we have in the previous examples, where matches is on a line of code after. However, we can combine these statements:\nimport re\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip()\nif matches := re.search(r\"^(.+), *(.+)$\", name):\n    name = matches.group(2) + \" \" + matches.group(1)\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nNotice how we combine two lines of our code. The walrus := operator assigns a value from right to left and allows us to ask a boolean question at the same time. Turn your head sideways and you’ll see why this is called a walrus operator.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of re.",

    "section": "Extracting User Input",
    "text": "Extracting User Input\n\nSo far, we have validated the user’s input and cleaned up the user’s input.\nNow, let’s extract some specific information from user input. In the terminal window, type code twitter.py and code as follows in the text editor window:\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\nprint(url)\nNotice that if we type in https://twitter.com/davidjmalan, it shows exactly what the user typed. However, how would we be able to extract just the username and ignore the rest of the URL?\nYou can imagine how we would simply be able to get rid of the beginning of the standard Twitter URL. We can attempt this as follows:\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\n\nusername = url.replace(\"https://twitter.com/\", \"\")\nprint(f\"Username: {username}\")\nNotice how the replace method allows us to find one item and replace it with another. In this case, we are finding part of the URL and replacing it with nothing. Typing in the full URL https://twitter.com/davidjmalan, the program effectively outputs the username. However, what are some shortcomings of this current program?\nWhat if the user simply typed twitter.com instead of including the https:// and the like? You can imagine many scenarios where the user may input or neglect to input parts of the URL that would create strange output by this program. To improve this program, we can code as follows:\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\n\nusername = url.removeprefix(\"https://twitter.com/\")\nprint(f\"Username: {username}\")\nNotice how we utilize the removeprefix method. This method will remove the beginning of a string.\nRegular expressions simply allow us to succinctly express the patterns and goals.\nWithin the re library, there is a method called sub. This method allows us to substitute a pattern with something else.\nThe signature of the sub method is as follows\nre.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)\nNotice how pattern refers to the regular expression we are looking for. Then, there is a repl string that we can replace the pattern with. Finally, there is the string that we want to do the substitution on.\nImplementing this method in our code, we can modify our program as follows:\nimport re\n\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\n\nusername = re.sub(r\"https://twitter.com/\", \"\", url)\nprint(f\"Username: {username}\")\nNotice how executing this program and inputting https://twitter.com/davidjmalan produces the correct outcome. However, there are some problems still present in our code.\nThe protocol, subdomain, and the possibility that the user inputted any part of the URL after the username are all reasons that this code is still not ideal. We can further address these shortcomings as follows:\nimport re\n\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\n\nusername = re.sub(r\"^(https?://)?(www\\.)?twitter\\.com/\", \"\", url)\nprint(f\"Username: {username}\")\nNotice how the ^ caret was added to the url. Notice also how the . could be interpreted improperly by the interpreter. Therefore, we escape it using a \\ to make it \\. For the purpose of tolerating both http and https, we add a ? to the end of https?, making the s optional. Further, to accommodate www we add (www\\.)? to our code. Finally, just in case the user decides to leave out the protocol altogether, the http:// or https:// is made optional using (https?://).\nStill, we are blindly expecting that what the user inputted a url that, indeed, has a username.\nUsing our knowledge of re.search, we can further improve our code.\nimport re\n\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\n\nmatches = re.search(r\"^https?://(www\\.)?twitter\\.com/(.+)$\", url, re.IGNORECASE)\nif matches:\n    print(f\"Username:\", matches.group(2))\nNotice how we are searching for the regular expression above in the string provided by the user. In particular, we are capturing that which appears at the end of the URL using (.+)$ regular expression. Therefore, if the user fails to input a URL without a username, no input will be presented.\nEven further tightening up our program, we can utilize our := operator as follows:\nimport re\n\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\n\nif matches := re.search(r\"^https?://(?:www\\.)?twitter\\.com/(.+)$\", url, re.IGNORECASE):\n    print(f\"Username:\", matches.group(1))\nNotice that the ?: tells the interpreter it does not have to capture what is in that spot in our regular expression.\nStill, we can be more explicit to ensure that the username inputted is correct. Using Twitter’s documentation, we can add the following to our regular expression:\nimport re\n\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\n\nif matches := re.search(r\"^https?://(?:www\\.)?twitter\\.com/([a-z0-9_]+)\", url, re.IGNORECASE):\n    print(f\"Username:\", matches.group(1))\nNotice that the [a-z0-9_]+ tells the interpreter to only expect a-z, 0-9, and _ as part of the regular expression. The + indicates that we are expecting one or more characters.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of re.",

    "section": "Global Variables",
    "text": "Global Variables\n\nIn other programming languages, there is the notion of global variables that are accessible to any function.\nWe can leverage this ability within Python. In the text editor window, code as follows:\nbalance = 0\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Balance:\", balance)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how we create a global variable called balance, outside of any function.\nSince no errors are presented by executing the code above, you’d think all is well. However, it is not! In the text editor window, code as follows:\nbalance = 0\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Balance:\", balance)\n    deposit(100)\n    withdraw(50)\n    print(\"Balance:\", balance)\n\n\ndef deposit(n):\n    balance += n\n\n\ndef withdraw(n):\n    balance -= n\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how we now add the functionality to add and withdraw funds to and from balance. However, executing this code, we are presented with an error! We see an error called UnboundLocalError. You might be able to guess that, at least in the way we’ve currently coded balance and our deposit and withdraw functions, we can’t reassign it a new value inside a function.\nTo interact with a global variable inside a function, the solution is to use the global keyword.

Now, our code functions!\nUtilizing our powers from our experience with object-oriented programming, we can modify our code to use a class instead of a global variable. In the text editor window, code as follows:\nclass Account:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._balance = 0\n\n    @property\n    def balance(self):\n        return self._balance\n\n    def deposit(self, n):\n        self._balance += n\n\n    def withdraw(self, n):\n        self._balance -= n\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = Account()\n    print(\"Balance:\", account.balance)\n    account.deposit(100)\n    account.withdraw(50)\n    print(\"Balance:\", account.balance)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how we use account = Account() to create an account. Classes allow us to solve this issue of needing a global variable more cleanly because these instance variables are accessible to all the methods of this class utilizing self.\nGenerally speaking, global variables should be used quite sparingly, if at all!",

But meow will likely want an int!\n\nA type hint can be added to give Python a hint of what type of variable meow should expect. In the text editor window, code as follows:\ndef meow(n: int):\n    for _ in range(n):\n        print(\"meow\")\n\n\nnumber = input(\"Number: \")\nmeow(number)\nNotice, though, that our program still throws an error.\nAfter installing mypy, execute mypy meows.py in the terminal window. mypy will provide some guidance about how to fix this error.\nYou can annotate all your variables.

Because we only attempt to print “meow”, not return a value, an error is thrown when we try to store the return value of meow in meows.\nWe can further use type hints to check for errors, this time annotating the return values of functions. In the text editor window, code as follows:\ndef meow(n: int) -&gt; None:\n    for _ in range(n):\n        print(\"meow\")\n\n\nnumber: int = int(input(\"Number: \"))\nmeows: str = meow(number)\nprint(meows)\nNotice how the notation -&gt; None tells mypy that there is no return value.\nWe can modify our code to return a string if we wish:\ndef meow(n: int) -&gt; str:\n    return \"meow\\n\" * n\n\n\nnumber: int = int(input(\"Number: \"))\nmeows: str = meow(number)\nprint(meows, end=\"\")\nNotice how we store in meows multiple strs.

How could we check all the arguments that could be inserted by the user? We might give up if we have more than a few command-line arguments!\nLuckily, argparse is a library that handles all the parsing of complicated strings of command-line arguments.

An object called parser is created from an ArgumentParser class. That class’s add_argument method is used to tell argparse what arguments we should expect from the user when they run our program. Finally, running the parser’s parse_args method ensures that all of the arguments have been included properly by the user.\nWe can also program more cleanly, such that our user can get some information about the proper usage of our code when they fail to use the program correctly.

You can write more powerful and elegant code by understanding how to unpack variables in seemingly more advanced ways. In the text editor window, code as follows:\ndef total(galleons, sickles, knuts):\n    return (galleons * 17 + sickles) * 29 + knuts\n\n\nprint(total(100, 50, 25), \"Knuts\")\nNotice how this returns the total value of Knuts.\nWhat if we wanted to store our coins in a list?

We can pass each value in by indexing using 0, 1, and so on.\nThis is getting quite verbose. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could simply pass the list of coins to our function?\nTo enable the possibility of passing the entire list, we can use unpacking.

We can index into it using keys, such as “galleons” or “sickles”.\nSince the total function expects three arguments, we cannot pass in a dictionary. We can use unpacking to help with this. In the text editor window, code as follows:\ndef total(galleons, sickles, knuts):\n    return (galleons * 17 + sickles) * 29 + knuts\n\n\ncoins = {\"galleons\": 100, \"sickles\": 50, \"knuts\": 25}\n\nprint(total(**coins), \"Knuts\")\nNotice how ** allows you to unpack a dictionary.

In the text editor window, code as follows:\ndef main():\n    n = int(input(\"What's n? \"))\n    for s in sheep(n):\n        print(s)\n\n\ndef sheep(n):\n    flock = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        flock.append(\"🐑\" * i)\n    return flock\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how we create a flock of sheep and return the flock.\nExecuting our code, you might try different numbers of sheep such as 10, 1000, and 10000. What if you asked for 1000000 sheep, your program might completely hang or crash. Because you have attempted to generate a massive list of sheep, your computer may be struggling to complete the computation.\nThe yield generator can solve this problem by returning a small bit of the results at a time. In the text editor window, code as follows:\ndef main():\n    n = int(input(\"What's n? \"))\n    for s in sheep(n):\n        print(s)\n\n\ndef sheep(n):\n    for i in range(n):\n        yield \"🐑\" * i\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how yield provides only one value at a time while the for loop keeps working.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of generators.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of iterators.",
