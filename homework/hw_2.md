## Advice

* Try out any of the programs from lectures via the source code tab on the [schedule page](module-schedule.html).
* See this [style guide for C](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/style/c/) for tips on how to improve your code style.
* If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. To decipher the error message meaning, try asking in discord, or tutorials. 

## Academic integrity

Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you.  AI use to **generate any code or text** related to assignments is **not permitted**.

The staff conduct audits of submissions to Computing Technology. Students found to be in violation of this policy will be referred for [Academic Misconduct](https://www.harper-adams.ac.uk/documents/Academic-misconduct-procedure.pdf).
