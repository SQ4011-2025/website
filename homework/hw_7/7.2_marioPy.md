## What to do

In a file called `mario.py` in a folder called `sentimental-mario-less`, write a program that recreates a half-pyramid using hashes (`#`) for blocks, exactly as you did in Problem Set 2. Your program this time should be written in Python!

**Specification**

* To make things more interesting, first prompt the user with `get_int` for the half-pyramid’s height, a positive integer between `1` and `8`, inclusive.
* If the user fails to provide a positive integer no greater than `8`, you should re-prompt for the same again.
* Then, generate (with the help of `print` and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid.
* Take care to align the bottom-left corner of your half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window.

**How to Test**

You’re encouraged to test your code on your own for each of the following.

* Run your program as `python mario.py` and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `-1` and press enter. Your program should reject this input as invalid, as by re-prompting the user to type in another number.
* Run your program as `python mario.py` and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `0` and press enter. Your program should reject this input as invalid, as by re-prompting the user to type in another number.
* Run your program as `python mario.py` and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `1` and press enter. Your program should generate the below output. Be sure that the pyramid is aligned to the bottom-left corner of your terminal, and that there are no extra spaces at the end of each line.

```bash
#

```

* Run your program as `python mario.py` and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `2` and press enter. Your program should generate the below output. Be sure that the pyramid is aligned to the bottom-left corner of your terminal, and that there are no extra spaces at the end of each line.

```bash
 #
##

```

* Run your program as `python mario.py` and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `8` and press enter. Your program should generate the below output. Be sure that the pyramid is aligned to the bottom-left corner of your terminal, and that there are no extra spaces at the end of each line.

```bash

* Run your program as `python mario.py` and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `9` and press enter. Your program should reject this input as invalid, as by re-prompting the user to type in another number. Then, type in `2` and press enter. Your program should generate the below output. Be sure that the pyramid is aligned to the bottom-left corner of your terminal, and that there are no extra spaces at the end of each line.

```bash

```

* Run your program as `python mario.py` and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `foo` and press enter. Your program should reject this input as invalid, as by re-prompting the user to type in another number.
* Run your program as `python mario.py` and wait for a prompt for input. Do not type anything, and press enter. Your program should reject this input as invalid, as by re-prompting the user to type in another number.
