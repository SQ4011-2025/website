## What to do

🐈 [1.1 Scratch](hw_1/1.1_scratch.html).

## Advice

If you have trouble running Scratch in your browser, use Chrome; consider downloading and installing the latest version of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), if you don’t have it already.

Here are [some examples](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30233348/) from lecture if you’d like to review! To see the source code of each, click **See inside**.

## Academic integrity

Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you.  AI use to **generate any code or text** related to assignments is **not permitted**.

The staff conduct audits of submissions to Computing Technology. Students found to be in violation of this policy will be referred for [Academic Misconduct](https://www.harper-adams.ac.uk/documents/Academic-misconduct-procedure.pdf).
