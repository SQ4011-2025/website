# Problem Set 7

## What to Do

1. Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), which is a cloud-based version of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) that provides you with your very own “codespace” with everything that you need for the course pre-installed. No need to download and install VS Code or Python on your own Mac or PC!
2. Execute `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure that your codespace is up-to-date; if prompted, click **Rebuild now**.
3. Submit all of the problems below:
   * [NUMB3RS](numb3rs/)
   * [Watch on YouTube](watch/)
   * [Working 9 to 5](working/)
   * [Regular, um, Expressions](um/)
   * [Response Validation](response/)
