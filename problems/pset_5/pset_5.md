# Problem Set 5

For this problem set, you’ll reimplement some past programs in such a way that you can also write tests for your own code!

## What to Do

1. Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), which is a cloud-based version of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) that provides you with your very own “codespace” with everything that you need for the course pre-installed. No need to download and install VS Code or Python on your own Mac or PC!
2. Execute `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure that your codespace is up-to-date; if prompted, click **Rebuild now**.
3. Submit all of the problems below:
   * [Testing my twttr](test_twttr/)
   * [Back to the Bank](test_bank/)
   * [Re-requesting a Vanity Plate](test_plates/)
   * [Refueling](test_fuel/)
