# Problem Set 4

## What to Do

1. Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), which is a cloud-based version of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) that provides you with your very own “codespace” with everything that you need for the course pre-installed. No need to download and install VS Code or Python on your own Mac or PC!
2. Execute `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure that your codespace is up-to-date; if prompted, click **Rebuild now**.
3. Submit all of the problems below:
   * [Emojize](emojize/)
   * [Frank, Ian and Glen’s Letters](figlet/)
   * [Adieu, Adieu](adieu/)
   * [Guessing Game](game/)
   * [Little Professor](professor/)
